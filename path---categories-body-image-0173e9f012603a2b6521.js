know you've heard it before- our culture is overly concerned with appearance. Everyone is after the hottest new trends and ways to look younger. Sex sells. Blah, blah, blah.</p>\n<p>I have been subconsciously buying into this deceit for my whole life.</p>\n<p>I remember in first grade my friend had a pair of jelly-shoes (remember those?!) and I was so jealous. I begged and begged until I finally got a pair. They still weren't as cool as her's... I even remember in first grade thinking I was chubby. Can you believe that! A six year old thinking she's chubby and comparing herself to other girls. Oh how I wish I knew the lies I was believing. I wish I could go back and hug my younger self and tell her how beautiful she was. I wonder if that would have changed how I think about myself now.</p>\n<p>Our culture sets women up for failure. We will never achieve the exact look we want. We will never have perfect outfits every day. We will have bad hair days. We will never be as toned, tight, or in shape as Jillian Michaels. Our culture wants to make sure we never 'arrive' there- what would society be able to sell us or convince us of if we were perfectly satisfied with who we are?</p>\n<p>I have spent more than fifteen years of my life thinking and worrying about my appearance. MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS. When I was laying in bed the other night reflecting on the meaning of life, which I do quite often, that thought popped into my head. That's a lot of thought energy wasted. I was lying there trying to figure out what to wear for work the next day. Like anyone actually cares what I wear... how silly... but I always try to look a little fashionable. I've wasted so much time and life thinking about those things.How much time have you used obsessing about your weight, clothing, new hair style?</p>\n<p>Be honest with yourself.</p>\n<p>Enough ladies. This needs to end.</p>\n<p>We were made for more!</p>\n<p>How can we help each other? How can we support one another to stop this cycle of belief? For myself, I will tell every six year old girl I see how beautiful they are. I will tell them how special God made them. I will tell them how everyone is different, and it's really exciting.

That person is smart, funny, fat, beautiful, passionate, lazy, crippled, perfect, etc. We let these categories define us. I've realized there are two categories I've been defining myself by for almost my whole life: my age and my weight.I'm learning andconstantly being reminded they are just numbers.</p>\n<p>Age\nLately people have been saying this phrase to me: \"Oh, you're too young to be feeling/doing/experiencing [fill in the blank].\"</p>\n<p>\"You're too young to be stressed.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're too young to be married.\"</p>\n<p>Even my dentist said to me, \"You're too young to have this issue with your teeth.\" (Whattt?!)</p>\n<p>Since when do all these issues have an age limit?! (I realize marriage does have legal age limits, which are necessary.) I find it frustrating because it feels like all these people are trying to make me wrong for something I'm experiencing-things that are completely out of my control. It feels demeaning. I do not believe those who talk like this are trying to put me down, but it's hard not to see that way. Has any one else ever had a similar experience?</p>\n<p>I could go on and on about how these people do not know my life experiences. They do not know the cause of my stressors. They do not know the careful thought and years I put into making the decision to marry the man of my dreams.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I feel judged.</p>\n<p>But if I'm being honest, I'm only judging myself.</p>\n<p>People who make comments about me being too young for these things don't even realize the depth of what they are saying to me. They don't know my past or even my present. I can't find them in the wrong.</p>\n<p>Why does this upset me?Does part of me agree with them?</p>\n<p>I've always believed that certain things happen at certain stages of your life. High school is supposedly the best time you'll ever have. Was it for me? Nope. College is suppose to be a crazy party, full of fun, all nighters, and great memories. While I had some of these, many times are overshadowed by the weight of getting good grades and balancing my personal life and professional life.</p>\n<p>I matured at a young age, started working at 14, and spent a lot of time while I was younger caring for my sisters. I've never fit into the mold. I've never 'acted my age' or even been treated my age.</p>\n<p>For most of my life I've loved that, but sometimes I despise that quality about me. I wanted to have those care-free youthful years. I feel robbed. I wanted to have a great experience in high school, didn't happen (I'm sure I'm not alone on this one). I don't want to have all this anxiety to work through.</p>\n<p>Maybe that's why I'm so sensitive about people telling me I'm too young to be experiencing whatever it is I'm experiencing. I want them to be right. I feel like I am too young for this. I want to go back in time and be carefree. When will I be old enough to experience these things?</p>\n<p>I'm experiencing life. You never know what will happen. There is no age limit. Some children have experienced more than I will ever experience in my lifetime.</p>\n<p>I have friends now who are in their thirties and forties. It's awesome. I never thought I could have friends so 'old'. But we have so much in common! They don't see me as a younger or inferior person. It's helped me to push past many of the labels I've put on age limits.</p>\n<p>I don't know how I'll react when the next person tells me I'm to young to be doing/feeling/experiencing whatever. I just hope I can learn to understand age is a number. It doesn't define me in any way.</p>\n<p>Weight\nDo you weigh yourself? Do you ever look at the scale and think, 'that can't be right...'</p>\n<p>Do you define yourself by the number you see on the scale? So many of us do that. It's a good day if you're 2 pounds down from last week. If you're 2 pounds up, your day is ruined.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps you never weigh yourself. I use to do that. Avoid the evil scale at all costs.</p>\n<p>Maybe you have your own method of measuring.You look in the mirror and notice your weight. Maybe you notice how your clothes fit. That's mostly what I do. Last fall when the weather started to cool off I brought out all my pants and sweaters from storage. I switched out my summer wardrobe for my fall one. I took a nice shower, got all ready, and attempted to put one of my old favorite jeans back on. Then I realized- they're too tight. I mean, I could probably wear them if I wanted to be super uncomfortable and constantly reminded that my hips were larger. It upset me for a while. And by a 'while' I mean like months. I'm just about over it now. Thank goodness!</p>\n<p>Why do I [we] care so much about our size?! That little number on the scale or on the tag on our jeans has so much power over our lives and our hearts.</p>\n<p>The scale goes up and down, clothes get smaller and larger, we are still who we are. As one of my favorite artists says:</p>\n<p>'What lasts longer in this life; character or rock hard thighs?' -Kendall Payne</p>\n<p>I've been so mean to myself trying to attain my ideal of beauty and the ideal weight. I realize something now, I'll never get there! Even when I was at my thinnest I still struggled with loving my body. The time is now. We need to rise above the battle of our weight issues and realize how insignificant they are in light of life and eternity. How do we want our future children, our future daughters, to think about their weight and body image?</p>\n<p>Age and weight are JUST A NUMBER. They don't define me. I am defined by my Creator and the inescapable love he has for me. What defines you?</p>\n<p>-Ashley</p>\n<p>I really like this new video from Dove's campaign.

Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just dont shoot their husbands, they just dont.\"</p>\n<p>Anyone?</p>\n<p>Every time I go to the gym and leave feeling awesome, I say this quote to myself in my head. It's not on purpose, it's like an involuntary thing that I'm slightly embarrassed about.</p>\n<p>I am a woman; therefore, like most women, I have body insecurities. I've had these insecurities since I was six or seven. I can remember being in first grade and not liking things about myself- how sad! Everything amplified in middle school and then high school. My friends and I basically thought it was cool to skip lunch. Eating anything meant we were just consuming too many calories. Totally logical, right?</p>\n<p>Today I can honestly say I love myself. Do I love everything about my body? Nope. I wish I did. It doesn't matter how many times my husband tells me I'm beautiful, sexy, perfect. I'm not satisfied.</p>\n<p>After graduating college and getting married I gained some weight. Seventeen pounds to be exact. But who's counting...? I was shocked, angry, mortified, disgusted with myself when the doctor told me the news. How can this little number have so much power over my life? Over our lives?</p>\n<p>That was around two months ago. Since that day I have been faithfully going to the gym. I've lost a little weight, but that doesn't really matter as much to me now. I feel amazing. Exercise helps me feel great about myself no matter what the scale says. It also helps with my stress and anxiety levels tremendously. I do some of my finer thinking while I'm plowing around the indoor track.</p>\n<p>Two years ago my doctor told me the solution to an anxiety disorder was exercise. She said if I like to run a mile, now it's time for me to run five. I didn't fully embrace her advice. I stuck to my yoga class routine, not noticing much difference. It has taken me almost two years to realize the necessity of hot and sweaty exercise in my life. (disclaimer- I do not, and cannot, run five miles).</p>\n<p>Maybe you remember a little bit about hormones and how they basically run your body. Maybe not. When you exercise your body releases chemicals called endorphins. Endorphins are known as the 'feel good hormone'. They trigger a positive feeling in the body and reduce the reception of pain. They are known to decrease the feelings of anxiety and depression. And let me tell you, it works.</p>\n<p>When I was in the midst of feeling awful, I went for two or three walks every day. It's the only thing that provided me relief.</p>\n<p>When you are depressed or anxious the last thing you want to do is put on a sports bra and go for a run. If you can get yourself dressed, you are half way there. You won't regret it afterwards.</p>\n<p>For more scientific information about endorphins and the powerful role they play in your body, check out this article here.</p>\n<p>I would love to, and probably will, share more about body insecurities and weight issues. But not today.</p>\n<p>I want to share what I know works.</p>\n<p>Exercise works.</p>\n<p>Next time you're feeling especially anxious go to the gym, go for a walk. Do something. Nothing we do has to be perfect. All we have to do is try our best, and let God fill in the gaps.</p>"}}}]}},pathContext:{category:"Body Image"}}}});
