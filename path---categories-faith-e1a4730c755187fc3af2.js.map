night when I am awoken by little hunger cries I roll out of bed, grab my sweater and head down the nightlight-lit hall to the nursery. I look down at the little boy wincing in his bassinet, pick him up, and gently kiss him on his forehead. In complete silence, with exception of his white noise machine, I change his diaper, re-swaddle, head to the rocking chair, and begin to nurse him back to comfort. We sit by the glow of Christmas lights. Just the two of us.</p>\\n<p>We're still getting to know each other.</p>\\n<p>He recognizes the sound of my voice and the smell of my skin. He just started turning his head towards me when I speak.</p>\\n<p>I am learning the meaning of his different cries. The hunger cries, the painful cries, the cries of boredom, and the desire for comfort.</p>\\n<p>When we first brought him home I didn't know if I could do it. I couldn't soothe him every time he fussed. I wasn't sure if he was hungry, uncomfortable, scared. My body hurt from the c-section and the drop in hormone levels left me with a floodgate of tears and nervousness.My husband and Iheard phantom cries every time we went into a different room and sometimes took turns outside with the dog just to get a break from the crying.</p>\\n<p>During our first week together in the middle of the night I was rocking my son for what seemed like hours. He wasn't crying but wasn't sleeping either. I was so tired; my lower back was aching from holding him in the same position, afraid that if I moved him he would never fall asleep. Then I caught a glimpse of our silhouette in the bedroom mirror. I could see the outline of my messy hair and bad posture. In my arms I was holding a baby. My baby. My child.</p>\\n<p>This is me, this is my identity now. Mother. It's my duty and purpose to be awake in the early hours of the morning rocking our son;could this be real? My reflection confirms my thoughts.</p>\\n<p>Every night I pass the mirror and see myself with a baby in my arms. Sometimes I just stop and stare... is that really me? Is this really us? It's like I want to seal the memory in my mind. It's a sacred moment, my son and me together in the dark.</p>\\n<p>Every day we learn a little more and life gets a little easier. Nothing is perfect but everything we are experiencing is perfectly human. I am thankful.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c6dfXLxkndK8g4osEywauG0\",\"title\":\"My Marriage: What I've Learned & What I Need to

honor of my husband's birthday this month I want to reflect a bit on our marriage,our sweet love story, and what I've learned through relationship.</p>\\n<p>I write this in almost every wedding card we give: <strong>Marriage is my favorite part of life right now.</strong> It's so amazing to live with your best friend, wake up to him every morning, cook with him or for him, hold hands, and live life knowing you have someone who fully supports and loves you. Some say, \\\"you're still in the honeymoon phase, just wait ten years\\\". We've heard that one before. Or, \\\"oh, it won't last\\\". Let me preface this post with some disclaimers and insights into my life.</p>\\n<p>First, I am not a marriage expert and would never claim to be. I am just blessed to be in a great marriage that honors the Lord and has a strong foundation. Secondly, while we've only been married less than three years, Jacob and I have been together almost six years and friends for nine years. I do believe the time spent together and growing together has given me tremendous knowledge about relationship. Lastly, our relationship is not without conflict. We spent the first two years of dating fighting almost on a weekly basis. Tears, angry phone calls, lack of trust, you name it. Long distance isn't the easiest. Conflict is included in my definition of a healthy relationship. In fact, the other day we gave each other the silent treatment for over an hour... it happens. It's only how you grow through the conflict that matters. I realize now I am writing this post as much for myself as for others. I need these remindersto look back on when life gets tough; when my anxiety levels rise and I need direction.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say, I do not believe the naysayers who claim love doesn't last, the honeymoon phase can't possibly last. I know too many people who are in strong committed relationships after ten, twenty, thirty years. In fact, I'm completely excited to grow old together. I want to be with him when our kids graduate high school, when we retire from work. I want to take care of him if he ever gets sick; live up to my vows through sickness and in health. It is my hope that through our relationship we can grow as individuals and be an example of the Lord's love on earth.</p>\\n<p>Since the moment I met Jacob when I was 15 (he was a cool college kid by then), I felt something special. We had an instant connection. He was attracted to my, let's say, beauty. And I just thought he was a goofy kid I loved to be around. It didn't take long for us to develop feelings for each other but life got in the way: other relationships, school, my fear of boys, and even family. I always knew somehow we'd end up together- soul mates? Who knows.</p>\\n<p>My friends would see us interact at college and constantly told me he was in love with me. I brushed it off. My grandmother sensed his affection for me and knew it was strong, I wasn't ready to hear it. I avoided Jacob when he started writing me letters and wanting to spend more time together. It was too real, too fast. Then he had a dream.</p>\\n<p>I really do believe God can speak through our dreams and this is a great example. He had a dream about me, and he took that as a sign it might be time to pursue more than a friendship. And for the first time in years I didn't completely resist him.</p>\\n<p>I credit Jacob for the traditional-ness of our relationship. I can't think of any other way to say it but he always tries to do the right thing. He asked my dad if he could date me, he waited patiently until I was ready, he didn't kiss me for almost three months after we started dating,and asked me if he could kiss me one night under the stars. He stressed respect, physical boundaries, communication, and honesty. I'm not sure how he got so wise but I have learned more from him about relationships than any book, sermon, tv show, or friend. To my wonderful mother and father in law, if you're reading this, you did something right!</p>\\n<p><strong>Six things I've learned from marriage:</strong></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>It is a reflection of the Lord's love and grace for us. It is through my marriage I've come to a deeper understanding of grace and forgiveness. Through marriage we can show the world God's design for family and relationship. It is through marriage we practice the love of the Lord on earth and show others that by His strength we can endure hardships. I've needed a lot of grace from Jacob over the years. I have struggles and he has struggles. By requiring so much grace and love from him I believe I've learned better how to give it and also receive it from the Lord.</li>\\n<li>My husband is loved by God. He is a child of God. I once heard a preacher say when you get married, God also becomes your father-in-law. Your spouse first belonged to the Lord and they are still cherished by their heavenly father. That really puts it into perspective for me. I love and value my spouse but God loves and values them more than I could ever understand. This principle is true for everyone in our lives, not just our spouses.</li>\\n<li>Love is a decision. I'm sure you've heard that before... but do you know its depth? Love is a commitment and a commitment I have to learn to choose even on the hard days. I have to choose to respond in love when all I want to do is scream and yell at Jacob and tell him how many ways he messed up. I have to choose to respond in love when he confesses something to me that hurts my feelings. I have to stick on love's side when he tells me how I've hurt him or ways I could grow as a person. Sometimes I don't respond in love right away. Sometimes I have to come back an hour or a day later and apologize for what I said or didn't say. That's the beauty of grace and forgiveness. We are both imperfect in our imperfect-ness. Commitmentis the only way love works.</li>\\n<li>Marriage is stinkin' hard but it's so unbelievably worth it. Life is not meant to be lived alone. We were created for our partner and our partner was created for us. If you're not married or don't plan on getting married, then switch the word 'marriage' with 'relationship'. Relationships can be so difficult but we were created for community!</li>\\n</ol>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The person who tries to live alone will not succeed as a human being. His heart withers if it does not answer another heart. His mind shrinks away if he hears only the echoes of his own thoughts and finds no other inspiration. -Pearl S. Buck</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<ol start=\\\"5\\\">\\n<li>We are both our own person. We were Jacob and Ashley, two distinctly unique human beings before we were married, and we are those same people today. Jacob has his own desires, wants, talents, and so do I. I do not own him. I cannot change him. He cannot make me fit any mold. We are who we are individually and together; and together we create something really special when we allow each other to be our own.</li>\\n<li>No other human being will ever fill the hole in my heart. C.S. Lewis referred to it as a 'God shaped hole'. It's so unfair for me to expect my husband to meet all my needs and fill every gaping wound in my soul. In fact, when I'm feeling down and angry at Jacob for not meeting one of my needs I have to stop and ask myself if there is a lack in my relationship with the Lord first. Am I expecting this person to make me feel whole when no human relationship was intended to do that?

Grandma is dying.</p>\\n<p>It's hard to live life when there's so much good and so much bad.</p>\\n<p>Living between anticipated new life and anticipated death is a weird space. And both are completely new to me. That's scary. I have no idea what it's like to give birth or to be a mother; and I have no idea what it's like to lose someone I truly love with all my soul.

I keep wondering if I'm in this cycle. Is there a stage called confusion? That seems more accurate. All those other feelings come and go. Who invented this formula for grief? How can anyone decide who experiences what? Maybe some people can't get past the depression; that is frightening. Maybe some people slip right into acceptance because their faith is so strong they know who is in control. I want that. I want so much trust in the Lord nothing so \\\"normal\\\" as life and death could shake me.</p>\\n<p>Alas, I am reminded of my humanness.

No line, no change in color, so I set it on the counter and started to brush my teeth. Didn't want to be late for work. I happened to glance back down at it before throwing it in the trash and I saw the beginning of a pink streak.</p>\\n<p>OH MY GOSH. (those weren't the exact words that came out...)</p>\\n<p>If my years working at a pregnancy center taught me anything it was that any pink line meant something was going on. This was real.</p>\\n<p>I always had the vision I would find out I was pregnant, keep it from my husband until I could come up with some cute little baby surprise and wow him. Well, none of that happens in real life.</p>\\n<p>I instantly woke him up, tried to get words out through my hyper breathing, and told him what the test said. He replied with a slobbery lisp through his nighttime mouth guard, \\\"Are you serious?\\\".</p>\\n<p>Pure romance.</p>\\n<p>I was told about three years ago from a doctor, \\\"Once you get pregnant, your anxiety will significantly improve. You will probably not need any medication and in fact, your hormone levels might stabilize and you'll never need medication again.\\\" That is not a direct quote but rather the gist of the conversation. I was skeptical of this projection; but really hoping and praying those words were true.</p>\\n<p>For me, they weren't.</p>\\n<p>In fact, my anxiety became unmanageable after my doctor told me to quickly ween of all medication and just suck it up. Maybe the pregnancy would give me more 'motivation'. Needless to say I was terrified, angry, and desperate for relief and peace.</p>\\n<p>All I could think about was how in the world was I suppose to be a mother when I could barely find the motivation to get through the day, let alone smile.</p>\\n<p>Since then I have sought the opinion of three other doctors (one of them being a highly-qualified specialist in maternal infant health psychiatry). I am back on a steady dose of medication, saw my therapist for a couple months, and feeling overall huge improvements.</p>\\n<p>I lost myself for a month. I was unable to enjoy and fully celebrate the fact I was creating life inside me because the worry, anxiety, and depression completely took over. If you are ever in a similar situation; seek multiple opinions. Ultimately you will know what's best. Most often the best decision is the one where you feel whole and complete. That's what my child needs; a mother who can be present, whole, complete, and peaceful.</p>\\n<p>Since finding out we were going to have a baby, life has gotten crazy. We realized we needed to move... a tiny 400 square-foot apartment with a baby and a black lab just wasn't how I wanted to spend my time. Thus began the searching and moving process.</p>\\n<p>Almost four months into my pregnancy I was driving home from work and was hit by a man trying to cross five lanes of traffic, right into the drivers side. That resulted in a multitude of medical tests and tears, all of which came back fine. We are praising the Lord for that!</p>\\n<p>Then my husband found out some not-so-encouraging medical news, which has completely upped my stress level.</p>\\n<p>Then our doggie hurt his paw and had to go to the emergency vet and wear the cone of shame for a whole week. He was even on dog narcotics! It was sad but almost comical to watch.</p>\\n<p>Then we bought our new car and it's already in the shop. We've owned it for four days.</p>\\n<p>I forgot to mention in the midst of all this I started a new job and Jacob is having trouble at his work. When my husband, who is always the calm one, is constantly stressed it really throws us for a loop.</p>\\n<p>My beloved grandmother is going through a possible cancer-scare, which has our whole family in tense waiting.</p>\\n<p>We are moving to a completely new city in a month and a half.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say I am so thankful for the medication I am able to take to help me cope with life lately. I am even more thankful for the Lord's constant provision and peace. <a href=\\\"https://bible.org/seriespage/60-compound-names-jehovah-jireh-rapha-nissi\\\">Jehovah-jireh</a>, the Lord provides. My favorite saying and my favorite truth to live day by day.</p>\\n<p>\\\"The Revelation of the Name <strong>Jehovah-Jireh</strong>, Genesis 22:12-14. The meaning of this name is The Lord Who Provides. The name is literally, The Lord Who Sees, or The Lord Who Will See To It. This is what we long for when we have a need that is personal and special; One who will see to our needs and provide for us. This is what Jehovah-Jireh means; the Lord Who will see to it that my every need is met. One Who knows my need because He sees.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Regular life stress can be really difficult for someone dealing with an anxiety disorder. What some can brush of and 'not worry about' can consume others. We have to be patient with those around us who we don't fully understand. I can't even express how much patience and compassion are necessary to help me through any struggle.</p>\\n<p>On a positive note, we are just days away from finding out the gender! Will we need a pink or blue nursery??</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"GJIfENJHCUkEk28SW6s4w\",\"title\":\"My Recent Lessons From God\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"},{\"id\":\"c2zAmsqajH2gqq2yiaIsGYK\",\"category\":\"Women's Issues\"}],\"slug\":\"my-recent-lessons-from-god\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.5105740181268883,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=200&h=132&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=400&h=265&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&h=530&q=50 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=1000&h=662&q=50 1000w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=200&h=132&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=400&h=265&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&h=530&q=50&fm=webp 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=1000&h=662&q=50&fm=webp 1000w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"blogpost1.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>I've gotten into a spiritual rut lately (I'm talking months and months here)- constantly praying to know God more, to feel his presence, to trust him more, to see his beauty around me.

I was hoping to learn something new and exciting but instead I was reminded of something I already knew but has completely pushed out of my mind: Those who seek the Lord find him when they seek him with all their hearts (Jeremiah 29:13). You mean I actually have to put effort into this?</p>\\n<p>Yes, yes I do. You do, too.</p>\\n<p>\\\"God provides everything we need, we have to avail ourselves to the things he provided.\\\" -April Barrett</p>\\n<p>I want to encourage you if you have a faith life but need to grow spiritually- it's time to take action. This morning I had some free time before my day started. To read Harry Potter or not to read Harry Potter... then I saw my devotional book sitting on the shelf. I didn't really feel like reading something serious but I paused and had a thought: my emotions and feelings can be deceiving. Just because I don't feel like something doesn't mean it's not right. I picked up the devotional and I so clearly heard from the Lord. The title was <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Utmost-His-Highest-Oswald-Chambers/dp/1572937378/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&#x26;dpID=41fpis7rWdL&#x26;dpSrc=sims&#x26;preST=_AC_UL320_SR214%2C320_&#x26;refRID=0FJ9A79WTX8Y862NFK3P\\\">\\\"Insight Not Emotion\\\".</a></p>\\n<p>\\\"If we try to reintroduce the rare moments of inspirations, it is a sign that it is not God we want. We are making a fetish of the moments when God did come and speak, and insisting that He must do it again; whereas what God wants us to do is to walk by faith...We must never make our moments of inspiration our standard; our standard is our duty.\\\"</p>\\n<p>The standard of my moments with the Lord and the knowledge of his presence in my life is my duty. Wow. <strong>In order to achieve oneness with him I have to make an effort, an actual effort.</strong> Moments of inspiration from the Lord are such a gift. This devotional says God will give us touches of his inspiration when we are not in danger of being led away by them. I really look forward to those moments when I can distinctly hear the voice of the Lord. They reassure my faith but they do not sustain it.</p>\\n<p>I love my husband every day not just the moments when he sweeps me off my feet and takes my breath away. Those occasions are special and rare; and that's the way I want it.</p>\\n<p>It's so hard to make time for something when we lack inspiration. I personally struggle with that. However, I still brush my teeth every day and do the dishes (not quite every day...). I just do it because it's the right thing to do. I brush my teeth because I want to care for my body and prevent future issues. I wash dishes because I like a clean home and don't want to smell the rot of old food.</p>\\n<p>Similarly, we can view our spiritual lives that way. We need to get rid of the rot and the stink that sometimes fills up our lives and a great way to do that is by seeking the Lord. But really, truly, seeking him.</p>\\n<p>I'm still working on this. Life can be so absolutely crazy I am thankful for the constant presence of God even when I lack motivation to seek him. That's how much he love us!</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c44PSEridSw86qOy0aIQEWY\",\"title\":\"Confessions of a Seeker of the

As I read them I can picture Jesus standing in a crowd, teaching his followers with his dirty sandals and unkempt hair. He doesn't notice his appearance because he is more focused on the beggar at the street corner.</p>\\n<p>I desperately want to be like that. I want to look past people's sexual orientations, political persuasions, past-lives, and addictions. I want to see their soul and meet them where they are like Jesus did.</p>\\n<p>I was first introduced to Christianity at a Baptist church.

And I am also thankful to have grown out of that mindset, realizing knowing the Lord is an issue of the heart not a matter of aformula.</p>\\n<p>But now, here I sit, a twenty-something Christian living in modern day America.

My goal is to convince my father I'm voting for Hilary Clinton. He might not be able to sleep at night, but it's too funny to resist.</p>\\n<p>I'm left with questions: who would Jesus vote for? What would modern-day American Jesus do with his free time?

Many are throwing ideas out there like all Muslim's should be deported until further questioning or Muslim immigration should not be allowed. People are making jokes about needing to build a fence to keep the Arabs out and not the Mexicans. Some are spreading anger and wanting to act with un-just violence.</p>\\n<p>Terrorism is real but to say that all Muslims need to be under scrutiny or leave the countryis like saying all adolescent white males who like video games are potentially mass-shooters and we should probably deport them until further notice.</p>\\n<p>If you haven't heard, there have been over 52 school shootings this year. The majority by white, middle-upper class males.</p>\\n<p>That is tragedy. Terrorism is tragedy. This world is full of tragedy. How can we combat this? I don't know. I do know it's not by actingfrom a place of fear or ignorance.</p>\\n<p>Every year in American history there have been racial tensions. Every decade there's a new group that's ostracized and stereotyped.</p>\\n<p>Native Americans were originally considered savages.</p>\\n<p>In 1902 Chinese immigration was made permanently illegal.</p>\\n<p>When Irish immigrants first came to the United States they were ridiculed and forced into slums.</p>\\n<p>In the 1920's Germans were seen as an evil threat, people were afraid they had radical political beliefs and would be the downfall of American society as we knew it. Some were deported, arrested, and probably tortured.</p>\\n<p>Jim Crow laws were practiced from the 1880's until 1965, and African Americans were seen as lesser for centuries. Some people still think this way.</p>\\n<p>Today we are fearful of illegal immigrants who are \\\"stealing our jobs and corrupting our county\\\" because they want a better life for their precious children and can't afford the legal application process. (I met a Guatemalan woman who has applied for a visa for her elderly mother at least three times, each time it was denied.

I buy groceries from them. I wave to them on the street while we are walking our dogs together. I take Zumba class with Muslim women; we talk about how much we would rather be eating french fries. I see them without their scarves on and feel like I know them in a secret way. They are real people with real lives.</p>\\n<p>I am aware I am not a military strategist. I don't understand all politics and I don't mean to say all people feel this way. I know some who do, and I can assure you know someone like this too. Someone who is acting from fear and not love.</p>\\n<p>We need to do our part to act with love and not give in to the fear and frenzy; that is the goal of terror-ism after all.</p>\\n<p>Find a way to rise above this battle.

can honestly say my marriage is my favorite part of life right now. Maybe one day it will be raising children, owning our own home, who knows what the future holds. Right now my happy place is in my husband's arms. In fact, it's been like that since the day we said \\\"I do\\\".</p>\\n<p>After our wedding ceremony we walked down the aisle and turned the corner to a hallway in our church. There we stole our first moment alone as husband and wife. I remember feeling so thankful, so relieved, and so emotional I just wept into his embrace. It was a moment of pure joy.</p>\\n<p>I get asked at work by students once in a while if I'm married. Always by some rowdy teenage boy (surprise).</p>\\n<p>I say yes I am, and routinely point to my wedding ring. Funny how no one notices! Maybe it's a guy thing. Maybe I need a flashing one or something.</p>\\n<p>Last week this happened again. After explaining the reason for the engagement ring and the wedding band- how they're different and which one you give first- one of the boys asked me if I loved my husband.</p>\\n<p>I said yes, I do love him.</p>\\n<p>No, do you really love him?</p>\\n<p>I said yes, he's a great guy.</p>\\n<p>Then he said do you really think you'll be together forever? Like honestly?</p>\\n<p>First of all, I find it intriguing he wanted to know. I don't know his family history or if he comes from a broken home but I know he told me he never wants to get married.</p>\\n<p>To answer his question, I paused. No one has ever asked me that before.</p>\\n<p>I replied with a yes, I do believe that.</p>\\n<p>He questioned my responsewith a squinting of his eyes and the cocking of his head.</p>\\n<p>The divorce rate is astronomical. Who gets married and truly commits to be together 'til death due you part anymore? It's more like \\\"I commit to you until you stop fulfilling my needs or I simply change my mind.\\\" (I do understand the legitimate need for divorce, especially Biblical reasons such as adultery, etc) However; I hear of MANY couples splitting up over reasons that aren't found in the Bible. Christian and non-Christian couples alike. Life happens, I get it. We make mistakes and we make choices.</p>\\n<p>I've been thinking about this conversation all week. Do I really believe we will be together forever? I'm terrified to commit to anything <strong>FOREVER.</strong></p>\\n<p>What a scary word!</p>\\n<p>What if he hurts my feelings? What if we lose the love and passion? What if I'm no longer physically attracted to him?</p>\\n<p>The answer is I committed myself in front of God and my family. I stood up on a stage in front of my younger siblings, who I would do anything for, as they heard me make a promise. Probably the most serious promise I will ever make in my lifetime; to love and honor this man despite the ebbs and flows of life.</p>\\n<p>We are \\\"young\\\", we are \\\"in love\\\", but we are also <strong>committed, loyal,</strong> and <strong>trusting</strong> in the Lord and his design for our marriage.</p>\\n<p>I hesitate to share these thoughts with all of you because I know marriage and divorce are sensitive subjects for some. I sympathize with all the pain the loss of a marriage uncovers. I have seen it in my family and with my closest friends. Mourning the end of a marriage is like mourning the death of a loved one. Something living, breathing, and sacred dies and the loss is felt in a heavy way. The good news is God brings beauty into all darkness.</p>\\n<p>If I could go back in time and compose a more thoughtful answer to this young man, I would say some of those things.</p>\\n<p>I want him to know that marriage can be beautiful. In fact, it was designed to be <strong>beautiful.</strong> I want him to know how the Lord's love is a great model for love in a marriage. How in forgiveness there is freedom.</p>\\n<p>I wish I could always be prepared with a thoughtful, inspiring, God-filled answer; alas, I am human. Maybe next time.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c7bUrX4VCX6cUmQwgqcSaEO\",\"title\":\"Jesus Gets

haven't written anything in a couple months because I've been tired, stressed, busy, a combination of all those things. Just dealing with life. And a new dog (he is super cute). And a new school year. And laundry.</p>\\n<p>I sometimes forget or neglect to sit down and think about things when I get so wrapped up in life. That's exactly what I needed to do: write, reflect, breathe, share.</p>\\n<p>I'm slightly mad at myself for putting these things off for the past two months but Jesus gets it. He understands. He was there.</p>\\n<p>I've been (very slowly) reading my way through a <a href=\\\"http://sheilawalsh.com/\\\">Sheila Walsh</a> book titled \\\"God Loves Broken People (And Those Who Pretend They're Not)\\\". Every page is juicy and makes me want to share it. I have little bookmarks and folded corners all over the book. Sheila admits she's broken and helps us see that we are too. She strongly emphasizes how the darkness in our souls can open us to the intimacy and love of Jesus we might not have known otherwise. Jesus suffered, he shares in our suffering.</p>\\n<p>\\\"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled,\\\" John 11:33</p>\\n<p>Sheila explains the word 'moved' here is translated from the Greek word 'embrimaomai'. That word is strong and represents anger, strength, or the bellowing and snorting of a horse. Some might say fury. Christ was feeling fury at the pain Mary and Martha were feeling in this situation. She points out that Christ rages with us.</p>\\n<p>How differently would we experience pain if we truly understood that Jesus feels with us?</p>\\n<p>I've been trying to reflect on that over the weekend. I was feeling anxious: Jesus gets it. I was frustrated: Jesus gets it. Jesus was the master of <a href=\\\"http://abovethebattle.com/the-beginning/\\\">rising above the battle.</a></p>\\n<p>God never promised us an easy journey but He did promise us He wins in the end (John 16:33).</p>\\n<p>When we're feeling lost, depressed, anxious, terrified, angry... let's take a moment to remember Jesus gets it. The God of the universe hears you, understands you.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c6hDsNJTy0wMKcaQw4Uk4oe\",\"title\":\"Poetry\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c5ORZhJRBfiwcyiOEMACoGK\",\"category\":\"Depression\"},{\"id\":\"G69JOFlSIogQYAiS0mW0G\",\"category\":\"Emotions\"},{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"}],\"slug\":\"poetry\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.500952380952381,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=400&h=266&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=788&h=525&q=50 788w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=200&h=133&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=400&h=266&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=788&h=525&q=50&fm=webp 788w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png\",\"fileName\":\"poetry.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>My husband and I are youth leaders at our church. This isn't something we necessarily planned; in fact, both of us would say we never desired to work with teenagers. The Lord must have had a plan because we've been leaders for over a year now, and we have fallen in love. Teenagers are complicated. Of course, I never thought I was a complicated or moody teenager- as I'm assuming most of them don't either. Adolescent years are key to discovering who you are, what you believe, and what you really want. I'm constantly being blown away by the depth of knowledge some of our students have. These two poems were written by girls just finishing up eight grade. They haven't experienced many years of life but they have lived through stuff I never hope to. I love these girls and think they have great potential! They shared some poems with me, and I wanted to share them with you:</p>\\n<p>Depression does not always mean beautiful girls shattering at their wrists. A glorified heroic battle for your sanity. Or a father's chance to say his last goodbye.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression is not getting out of bed for three days because your feet refuse to believe that they will not shatter upon impact with the floor.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression means that summoning the will power to go down stairs and do laundry is the most impressive thing you've accomplished all week.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression means lying on the floor staring at the ceiling for hours because you cannot convince your body that it is capable of movement.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression meansnot being able to write for weeks because the only words that you have to offer the world are trapped and drowning and I swear to God I'm trying.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression means that every single bone in your body aches but you have to keep going through the motions.Because you are not aloud to call into work or school 'depressed'.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression means ignoring every phone call for an entire month. Because yes, they have the right number, but you're not the person they're looking for, not anymore.</p>\\n<p>-C.</p>\\n<p>She was lost and broken inside.</p>\\n<p>No one to run to and no where to hide.</p>\\n<p>Someone came along and broke her down, she felt like she was going to drown.</p>\\n<p>Now she's completely done.</p>\\n<p>All she wanted to do was run.</p>\\n<p>Broken home, broken family, all she wanted to do was grow up happily.</p>\\n<p>Chased after a guy, and all he said was lies.</p>\\n<p>Now she has a broken heart, and soon to find someone to turn it into a work of art.</p>\\n<p>All tangled up in depression, and all she needs is another session.</p>\\n<p>Too much emotional pain is making her insane.</p>\\n<p>Prays every night and just wants to take flight into the brightest light.</p>\\n<p>Met a guy over the summer, then had to leave, what a bummer.</p>\\n<p>At her apartment, has too much to drink and needs to think.</p>\\n<p>Collapses to the floor, all of a sudden he busts open the door.</p>\\n<p>Laying in a hospital bed, he thought she was dead.</p>\\n<p>She sees him sitting in the chair, and thought he would never care.</p>\\n<p>He gets up, kisses her forehead, and whispers don't go back to bed.</p>\\n<p>-S.</p>\\n<p>On a side note, I love poetry. I'm not an avid writer or reader, but I often get sucked in. It amazes me how a specific compilation of words can produce such emotion. I know many people who use poetry or spoken word to get things off their chest and to express themselves.

Shocker, right? Well to some people this could be confusing or borderline blasphemous. For others, it's just a conversation starter. Let me explain my journey to this conclusion.</p>\\n<p>About three years ago I was attending a Christian college, I was an RA, and I was trying to pursue my degree in Social Work whole-heartedly. In the midst of college life, my relationship and my understanding of the Lord got pushed to the side. I attended chapel a couple times a week and I was living in a 'good' environment so I didn't pursue the need to expand my understanding of God. I just happened to stumble into a conversation which completely shifted my perspective of him. Some would say coincidence, I say divine planning.</p>\\n<p>I was having lunch with my old boss and I can remember before every meeting I would tell myself 'I don't feel like talking a lot today, I don't want to have deep conversations, I don't want my thoughts and feelings analyzed'. Somehow that never worked out. We always ended up having meaningful conversation and I didn't know it at the time but she taught me a lot about myself and about the Lord.</p>\\n<p>Anyways, we were eating a dry sandwich and some creamy, unhealthy soup. It was a cloudy day. Somehow we got talking about God and all of a sudden I had this revelation. God is NOT a man. It might have been inspired by something I was doing earlier in the day, I can't really remember. But either way, sincethat moment my comprehension of God, of the God of the entire universe, has been shifted.</p>\\n<p>In layman's terms, my mind was blown.</p>\\n<p>I once heard a pastor say, God isnt Gender-less he is Gender-full.</p>\\n<p>Was I allowed to think this? Could I ever share this revelation with other people, or would they think I was a liberal, hippie, feel-good Christian? I've thought a lot about this. And I have come to a conclusion: it's my opinion. I'm going to share my opinion whenever someone wishes to hear it. Simple as that.</p>\\n<p>We try to make God fit our mold. Many artists over the centuries have tried to depict the Lord and I would say the majority of them display him as an old man with a white beard, floating on a cloud. They depict him as towering over us, looking down with all his white-haired wisdom, constantly watching. I realized that is not God. That's not the God I see or I want to see. (Disclaimer* I do fully believe Jesus was a man, that is historically recorded)</p>\\n<p>So, how did this revelation free my mind? I believe our understanding of God changes our relationship with him (or her) ;).</p>\\n<p>I believe by pursuing and seeking the Lord and expanding my understanding, I will also expand my relationship. And it is my personal opinion nothing bad will ever come of expanding our understanding of the Lord and our relationship with him. It's a win-win!</p>\\n<p>Humankind was created as Gods reflection: in the divine image God created them; female and male, God made them.\\\" Genesis 1:27</p>\\n<p>We were created in God's image! God's image is both female and male. Interesting... huh?</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c2G18fIbb8cqEGwKkKc0aog\",\"title\":\"Reminder: Not All Stress is Bad Stress\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"}],\"slug\":\"reminder-not-all-stress-is-bad-stress\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png\",\"fileName\":\"TODAY.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>One thing i've learned about myself over the past few years; I'm afraid of stress. Any hint of stress in my body or my mind makes me feel weak and stupid. Somewhere deep down inside I feel like I should be able to handle anything, everything. Maybe it's because for long period of my life I did. I handled everything. I handled things beyond what I should have or what I needed to. It was my way of creating peace out of the chaos around me.</p>\\n<p>I just started a new job, this week in fact. I started a whole new career, in a whole new place, and on a whole new time schedule. Last week I felt some stress about it- but not as much as I probably needed to allow myself to feel.</p>\\n<p>This is how it happens...</p>\\n<p>My heart race picks up slowly, my body temperature rises slightly, and then the fear sets in.</p>\\n<p>Oh no, it's happening. I must be stressed about something.</p>\\n<p>My heart races faster. I feel glimpses of panic.</p>\\n<p>And then come the thoughts; I can't handle anything, how am I going to get through this new week, why do I put myself through so much stress... you get the picture.</p>\\n<p>The issue here is, stress is okay! It's a natural part of life-especially when you're starting a new job or a new chapter of your life. Stress can be used for positive motivation. Fight or flight. It helps us get things done and gain motivation when we feel like we have none. Some pressure can be good!</p>\\n<p>That's something I have to constantly remind myself: It's okay to feel stress. Not all stress is bad stress. Feeling stress is not a sign of weakness.</p>\\n<p>On the car ride to my new job at 6:30 am I began to feel a little panic rise up somewhere from my gut. Thankfully, I realized what was hapening and took some nice deep breaths. Then I prayed- gave it all over to God. When I give my stress to God, there's nothing left to call my own and beat myself up for. It's something I do to try and be more kind to myself.</p>\\n<p>Day two of the new job, I felt stress trying to get through all of my errands after work and still fit in exercise and dinner somewhere. I took a lot of deep breaths that day. Day three, thought I was having a severe allergic reaction to my breakfast on the way to work. I was eating toast. Toast! I took a lot of deep breaths that morning too.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say, I'm still learning to allow stress in my life. And I'm learning to forgive myself when I forget. Do you allow a little good stress in your life?</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c6daDjGiVoWMeGgs6wSQiao\",\"title\":\"Why We Need a Source of Peace\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"},{\"id\":\"c1UGVSypiscCcEM6OMmSIKw\",\"category\":\"Peace\"}],\"slug\":\"why-we-need-a-source-of-peace\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=560&h=560&q=50 560w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=560&h=560&q=50&fm=webp 560w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png\",\"fileName\":\"TodayithankGod.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Life is hard. Awful things happen. Any illusion of control we have over our lives is just that- an illusion. This can cause stress, worry, anxiety, depression, anger, and just basic fear. I have experienced all of those due to my illusion of control. My greatest source of strength and peace has come from my higher power, Jesus Christ. Whether you are a Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, my goal is not to convert you. My goal is to share with you the necessity of having a power greater than ourselves to bring peace and strength.</p>\\n<p>Life wasn't made to be lived alone. I believe that means spiritually and physically. We need other people in our lives; we need our friends, family, spouse, dog, whatever. We also need to nourish our spiritual selves and realize we aren't created to be alone spiritually either. We aren't souls floating on this planet for no concrete reason and without a purpose. There is a God out there who wants to dwell in us and is just jumping at the chance to bring us peace.</p>\\n<p>Jesus gives me peace.</p>\\n<p>He has been my source of strength and my only source of hope through this whole journey. The only thing that kept me going when I was at my worst was the knowledge that God knew my pain. If he knew my pain I had to believe he had a plan. And from my experience God always turns ugliness into beauty. He truly does make all things beautiful (Ecclesiastes 3:11). But in his time, not ours. I wanted healing right away. I wanted to go to sleep and wake up the next day fully restored to my old self- whatever that felt like. After a couple weeks of that not happening, actually seeming worse, I realized I had to surrender to Gods timing. It didn't happen in one big moment. It happened hundreds of times. Every hour. Sometimes every five minutes. It's still happening.</p>\\n<p>I don't know how anyone can't get through life without faith in God. Faith in a higher power. Faith in someone or something that loves us and has a plan and a purpose for our lives. I don't understand the mystery of Christ but I do believe. The spirit of God is alive in my life and that's the only way I can explain it.</p>\\n<p>This Easter was more significant for me than in Year's past. Ihad the chance toreally reflect on the last week of Jesus' life. I tried to picture him in the garden praying to God the day before he knew he was going to die. I tried to picture the weight of the world's sin and guilt hanging on his shoulders. Every amount of shame and guilt I have ever felt, he carried. I tried to wrap my mind around the sacrifice of his life for us. I can't figure it out. But I believe it.

night when I am awoken by little hunger cries I roll out of bed, grab my sweater and head down the nightlight-lit hall to the nursery. I look down at the little boy wincing in his bassinet, pick him up, and gently kiss him on his forehead. In complete silence, with exception of his white noise machine, I change his diaper, re-swaddle, head to the rocking chair, and begin to nurse him back to comfort. We sit by the glow of Christmas lights. Just the two of us.</p>\\n<p>We're still getting to know each other.</p>\\n<p>He recognizes the sound of my voice and the smell of my skin. He just started turning his head towards me when I speak.</p>\\n<p>I am learning the meaning of his different cries. The hunger cries, the painful cries, the cries of boredom, and the desire for comfort.</p>\\n<p>When we first brought him home I didn't know if I could do it. I couldn't soothe him every time he fussed. I wasn't sure if he was hungry, uncomfortable, scared. My body hurt from the c-section and the drop in hormone levels left me with a floodgate of tears and nervousness.My husband and Iheard phantom cries every time we went into a different room and sometimes took turns outside with the dog just to get a break from the crying.</p>\\n<p>During our first week together in the middle of the night I was rocking my son for what seemed like hours. He wasn't crying but wasn't sleeping either. I was so tired; my lower back was aching from holding him in the same position, afraid that if I moved him he would never fall asleep. Then I caught a glimpse of our silhouette in the bedroom mirror. I could see the outline of my messy hair and bad posture. In my arms I was holding a baby. My baby. My child.</p>\\n<p>This is me, this is my identity now. Mother. It's my duty and purpose to be awake in the early hours of the morning rocking our son;could this be real? My reflection confirms my thoughts.</p>\\n<p>Every night I pass the mirror and see myself with a baby in my arms. Sometimes I just stop and stare... is that really me? Is this really us? It's like I want to seal the memory in my mind. It's a sacred moment, my son and me together in the dark.</p>\\n<p>Every day we learn a little more and life gets a little easier. Nothing is perfect but everything we are experiencing is perfectly human. I am thankful.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c6dfXLxkndK8g4osEywauG0\",\"title\":\"My Marriage: What I've Learned & What I Need to

honor of my husband's birthday this month I want to reflect a bit on our marriage,our sweet love story, and what I've learned through relationship.</p>\\n<p>I write this in almost every wedding card we give: <strong>Marriage is my favorite part of life right now.</strong> It's so amazing to live with your best friend, wake up to him every morning, cook with him or for him, hold hands, and live life knowing you have someone who fully supports and loves you. Some say, \\\"you're still in the honeymoon phase, just wait ten years\\\". We've heard that one before. Or, \\\"oh, it won't last\\\". Let me preface this post with some disclaimers and insights into my life.</p>\\n<p>First, I am not a marriage expert and would never claim to be. I am just blessed to be in a great marriage that honors the Lord and has a strong foundation. Secondly, while we've only been married less than three years, Jacob and I have been together almost six years and friends for nine years. I do believe the time spent together and growing together has given me tremendous knowledge about relationship. Lastly, our relationship is not without conflict. We spent the first two years of dating fighting almost on a weekly basis. Tears, angry phone calls, lack of trust, you name it. Long distance isn't the easiest. Conflict is included in my definition of a healthy relationship. In fact, the other day we gave each other the silent treatment for over an hour... it happens. It's only how you grow through the conflict that matters. I realize now I am writing this post as much for myself as for others. I need these remindersto look back on when life gets tough; when my anxiety levels rise and I need direction.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say, I do not believe the naysayers who claim love doesn't last, the honeymoon phase can't possibly last. I know too many people who are in strong committed relationships after ten, twenty, thirty years. In fact, I'm completely excited to grow old together. I want to be with him when our kids graduate high school, when we retire from work. I want to take care of him if he ever gets sick; live up to my vows through sickness and in health. It is my hope that through our relationship we can grow as individuals and be an example of the Lord's love on earth.</p>\\n<p>Since the moment I met Jacob when I was 15 (he was a cool college kid by then), I felt something special. We had an instant connection. He was attracted to my, let's say, beauty. And I just thought he was a goofy kid I loved to be around. It didn't take long for us to develop feelings for each other but life got in the way: other relationships, school, my fear of boys, and even family. I always knew somehow we'd end up together- soul mates? Who knows.</p>\\n<p>My friends would see us interact at college and constantly told me he was in love with me. I brushed it off. My grandmother sensed his affection for me and knew it was strong, I wasn't ready to hear it. I avoided Jacob when he started writing me letters and wanting to spend more time together. It was too real, too fast. Then he had a dream.</p>\\n<p>I really do believe God can speak through our dreams and this is a great example. He had a dream about me, and he took that as a sign it might be time to pursue more than a friendship. And for the first time in years I didn't completely resist him.</p>\\n<p>I credit Jacob for the traditional-ness of our relationship. I can't think of any other way to say it but he always tries to do the right thing. He asked my dad if he could date me, he waited patiently until I was ready, he didn't kiss me for almost three months after we started dating,and asked me if he could kiss me one night under the stars. He stressed respect, physical boundaries, communication, and honesty. I'm not sure how he got so wise but I have learned more from him about relationships than any book, sermon, tv show, or friend. To my wonderful mother and father in law, if you're reading this, you did something right!</p>\\n<p><strong>Six things I've learned from marriage:</strong></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>It is a reflection of the Lord's love and grace for us. It is through my marriage I've come to a deeper understanding of grace and forgiveness. Through marriage we can show the world God's design for family and relationship. It is through marriage we practice the love of the Lord on earth and show others that by His strength we can endure hardships. I've needed a lot of grace from Jacob over the years. I have struggles and he has struggles. By requiring so much grace and love from him I believe I've learned better how to give it and also receive it from the Lord.</li>\\n<li>My husband is loved by God. He is a child of God. I once heard a preacher say when you get married, God also becomes your father-in-law. Your spouse first belonged to the Lord and they are still cherished by their heavenly father. That really puts it into perspective for me. I love and value my spouse but God loves and values them more than I could ever understand. This principle is true for everyone in our lives, not just our spouses.</li>\\n<li>Love is a decision. I'm sure you've heard that before... but do you know its depth? Love is a commitment and a commitment I have to learn to choose even on the hard days. I have to choose to respond in love when all I want to do is scream and yell at Jacob and tell him how many ways he messed up. I have to choose to respond in love when he confesses something to me that hurts my feelings. I have to stick on love's side when he tells me how I've hurt him or ways I could grow as a person. Sometimes I don't respond in love right away. Sometimes I have to come back an hour or a day later and apologize for what I said or didn't say. That's the beauty of grace and forgiveness. We are both imperfect in our imperfect-ness. Commitmentis the only way love works.</li>\\n<li>Marriage is stinkin' hard but it's so unbelievably worth it. Life is not meant to be lived alone. We were created for our partner and our partner was created for us. If you're not married or don't plan on getting married, then switch the word 'marriage' with 'relationship'. Relationships can be so difficult but we were created for community!</li>\\n</ol>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The person who tries to live alone will not succeed as a human being. His heart withers if it does not answer another heart. His mind shrinks away if he hears only the echoes of his own thoughts and finds no other inspiration. -Pearl S. Buck</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<ol start=\\\"5\\\">\\n<li>We are both our own person. We were Jacob and Ashley, two distinctly unique human beings before we were married, and we are those same people today. Jacob has his own desires, wants, talents, and so do I. I do not own him. I cannot change him. He cannot make me fit any mold. We are who we are individually and together; and together we create something really special when we allow each other to be our own.</li>\\n<li>No other human being will ever fill the hole in my heart. C.S. Lewis referred to it as a 'God shaped hole'. It's so unfair for me to expect my husband to meet all my needs and fill every gaping wound in my soul. In fact, when I'm feeling down and angry at Jacob for not meeting one of my needs I have to stop and ask myself if there is a lack in my relationship with the Lord first. Am I expecting this person to make me feel whole when no human relationship was intended to do that? My grandmother always told me those close to you are your easiest targets for taking out any negative feelings. Boy was she right.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Here's to you Jacob; I'm thankful for your 28 years of life and for choosing me to share the journey with you. Thank you for being committed to our marriage and for giving me security and love like I've never known.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"tOQlNA9lyoskcoUgqMEqm\",\"title\":\"Between Life & Death\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c5ORZhJRBfiwcyiOEMACoGK\",\"category\":\"Depression\"},{\"id\":\"G69JOFlSIogQYAiS0mW0G\",\"category\":\"Emotions\"},{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"}],\"slug\":\"between-life-death\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png\",\"fileName\":\"052819-1.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>I'm sitting here on my balcony looking at the last little triangle of sunlight shining on a tree as it sets behind us. I'm tired. Baby is rumbling around inside; I can see his little kicks through my shirt. Husband is unwinding with a video game. Dog is resting. Grandma is dying.</p>\\n<p>It's hard to live life when there's so much good and so much bad.</p>\\n<p>Living between anticipated new life and anticipated death is a weird space. And both are completely new to me. That's scary. I have no idea what it's like to give birth or to be a mother; and I have no idea what it's like to lose someone I truly love with all my soul. Yet both are inevitably going to happen, and sooner than I feel ready for.</p>\\n<p>Tears burn my eyes. My throat feels like it's closing in as I try to not let emotion overcome me. The sadness and the fear are so strong in these moments.</p>\\n<p>I take a few minutes to check social media because I'm not sure what I'm trying to say or where my thoughts are headed. All I know is that I'm caught in a gray area- dark gray. That means it's time to pray.</p>\\n<p>There are five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. I keep wondering if I'm in this cycle. Is there a stage called confusion? That seems more accurate. All those other feelings come and go. Who invented this formula for grief? How can anyone decide who experiences what? Maybe some people can't get past the depression; that is frightening. Maybe some people slip right into acceptance because their faith is so strong they know who is in control. I want that. I want so much trust in the Lord nothing so \\\"normal\\\" as life and death could shake me.</p>\\n<p>Alas, I am reminded of my humanness. I see my humanness in the sadness of my sister, the stress of my grandfather, the tears of my uncle, and the embrace of my husband. We are in this together.</p>\\n<p>Last night my grandmother was asked, \\\"What is one thing you want to leave with us?\\\" Her response, \\\"We are all one.\\\"</p>\\n<p><strong>We are all one.</strong></p>\\n<p>Grandma and I are one. My grandmother and my son are one. Even in her final days when all I want to do is help her, she is teaching us all.

No line, no change in color, so I set it on the counter and started to brush my teeth. Didn't want to be late for work. I happened to glance back down at it before throwing it in the trash and I saw the beginning of a pink streak.</p>\\n<p>OH MY GOSH. (those weren't the exact words that came out...)</p>\\n<p>If my years working at a pregnancy center taught me anything it was that any pink line meant something was going on. This was real.</p>\\n<p>I always had the vision I would find out I was pregnant, keep it from my husband until I could come up with some cute little baby surprise and wow him. Well, none of that happens in real life.</p>\\n<p>I instantly woke him up, tried to get words out through my hyper breathing, and told him what the test said. He replied with a slobbery lisp through his nighttime mouth guard, \\\"Are you serious?\\\".</p>\\n<p>Pure romance.</p>\\n<p>I was told about three years ago from a doctor, \\\"Once you get pregnant, your anxiety will significantly improve. You will probably not need any medication and in fact, your hormone levels might stabilize and you'll never need medication again.\\\" That is not a direct quote but rather the gist of the conversation. I was skeptical of this projection; but really hoping and praying those words were true.</p>\\n<p>For me, they weren't.</p>\\n<p>In fact, my anxiety became unmanageable after my doctor told me to quickly ween of all medication and just suck it up. Maybe the pregnancy would give me more 'motivation'. Needless to say I was terrified, angry, and desperate for relief and peace.</p>\\n<p>All I could think about was how in the world was I suppose to be a mother when I could barely find the motivation to get through the day, let alone smile.</p>\\n<p>Since then I have sought the opinion of three other doctors (one of them being a highly-qualified specialist in maternal infant health psychiatry). I am back on a steady dose of medication, saw my therapist for a couple months, and feeling overall huge improvements.</p>\\n<p>I lost myself for a month. I was unable to enjoy and fully celebrate the fact I was creating life inside me because the worry, anxiety, and depression completely took over. If you are ever in a similar situation; seek multiple opinions. Ultimately you will know what's best. Most often the best decision is the one where you feel whole and complete. That's what my child needs; a mother who can be present, whole, complete, and peaceful.</p>\\n<p>Since finding out we were going to have a baby, life has gotten crazy. We realized we needed to move... a tiny 400 square-foot apartment with a baby and a black lab just wasn't how I wanted to spend my time. Thus began the searching and moving process.</p>\\n<p>Almost four months into my pregnancy I was driving home from work and was hit by a man trying to cross five lanes of traffic, right into the drivers side. That resulted in a multitude of medical tests and tears, all of which came back fine. We are praising the Lord for that!</p>\\n<p>Then my husband found out some not-so-encouraging medical news, which has completely upped my stress level.</p>\\n<p>Then our doggie hurt his paw and had to go to the emergency vet and wear the cone of shame for a whole week. He was even on dog narcotics! It was sad but almost comical to watch.</p>\\n<p>Then we bought our new car and it's already in the shop. We've owned it for four days.</p>\\n<p>I forgot to mention in the midst of all this I started a new job and Jacob is having trouble at his work. When my husband, who is always the calm one, is constantly stressed it really throws us for a loop.</p>\\n<p>My beloved grandmother is going through a possible cancer-scare, which has our whole family in tense waiting.</p>\\n<p>We are moving to a completely new city in a month and a half.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say I am so thankful for the medication I am able to take to help me cope with life lately. I am even more thankful for the Lord's constant provision and peace. <a href=\\\"https://bible.org/seriespage/60-compound-names-jehovah-jireh-rapha-nissi\\\">Jehovah-jireh</a>, the Lord provides. My favorite saying and my favorite truth to live day by day.</p>\\n<p>\\\"The Revelation of the Name <strong>Jehovah-Jireh</strong>, Genesis 22:12-14. The meaning of this name is The Lord Who Provides. The name is literally, The Lord Who Sees, or The Lord Who Will See To It. This is what we long for when we have a need that is personal and special; One who will see to our needs and provide for us. This is what Jehovah-Jireh means; the Lord Who will see to it that my every need is met. One Who knows my need because He sees.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Regular life stress can be really difficult for someone dealing with an anxiety disorder. What some can brush of and 'not worry about' can consume others. We have to be patient with those around us who we don't fully understand. I can't even express how much patience and compassion are necessary to help me through any struggle.</p>\\n<p>On a positive note, we are just days away from finding out the gender! Will we need a pink or blue nursery??</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"GJIfENJHCUkEk28SW6s4w\",\"title\":\"My Recent Lessons From God\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"},{\"id\":\"c2zAmsqajH2gqq2yiaIsGYK\",\"category\":\"Women's Issues\"}],\"slug\":\"my-recent-lessons-from-god\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.5105740181268883,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=200&h=132&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=400&h=265&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&h=530&q=50 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=1000&h=662&q=50 1000w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=200&h=132&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=400&h=265&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&h=530&q=50&fm=webp 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=1000&h=662&q=50&fm=webp 1000w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"blogpost1.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>I've gotten into a spiritual rut lately (I'm talking months and months here)- constantly praying to know God more, to feel his presence, to trust him more, to see his beauty around me. It't not always easy to find the motivation or sense of urgency to study his Word and truly submit myself in prayer. Most days I don't 'feel' like it and honestly, I've had the thought \\\"if the Lord wants me to know him better, he will reveal himself to me.\\\"</p>\\n<p>I recently went to my first women's retreat with church. I was hoping to learn something new and exciting but instead I was reminded of something I already knew but has completely pushed out of my mind: Those who seek the Lord find him when they seek him with all their hearts (Jeremiah 29:13). You mean I actually have to put effort into this?</p>\\n<p>Yes, yes I do. You do, too.</p>\\n<p>\\\"God provides everything we need, we have to avail ourselves to the things he provided.\\\" -April Barrett</p>\\n<p>I want to encourage you if you have a faith life but need to grow spiritually- it's time to take action. This morning I had some free time before my day started. To read Harry Potter or not to read Harry Potter... then I saw my devotional book sitting on the shelf. I didn't really feel like reading something serious but I paused and had a thought: my emotions and feelings can be deceiving. Just because I don't feel like something doesn't mean it's not right. I picked up the devotional and I so clearly heard from the Lord. The title was <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Utmost-His-Highest-Oswald-Chambers/dp/1572937378/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&#x26;dpID=41fpis7rWdL&#x26;dpSrc=sims&#x26;preST=_AC_UL320_SR214%2C320_&#x26;refRID=0FJ9A79WTX8Y862NFK3P\\\">\\\"Insight Not Emotion\\\".</a></p>\\n<p>\\\"If we try to reintroduce the rare moments of inspirations, it is a sign that it is not God we want. We are making a fetish of the moments when God did come and speak, and insisting that He must do it again; whereas what God wants us to do is to walk by faith...We must never make our moments of inspiration our standard; our standard is our duty.\\\"</p>\\n<p>The standard of my moments with the Lord and the knowledge of his presence in my life is my duty. Wow. <strong>In order to achieve oneness with him I have to make an effort, an actual effort.</strong> Moments of inspiration from the Lord are such a gift. This devotional says God will give us touches of his inspiration when we are not in danger of being led away by them. I really look forward to those moments when I can distinctly hear the voice of the Lord. They reassure my faith but they do not sustain it.</p>\\n<p>I love my husband every day not just the moments when he sweeps me off my feet and takes my breath away. Those occasions are special and rare; and that's the way I want it.</p>\\n<p>It's so hard to make time for something when we lack inspiration. I personally struggle with that. However, I still brush my teeth every day and do the dishes (not quite every day...). I just do it because it's the right thing to do. I brush my teeth because I want to care for my body and prevent future issues. I wash dishes because I like a clean home and don't want to smell the rot of old food.</p>\\n<p>Similarly, we can view our spiritual lives that way. We need to get rid of the rot and the stink that sometimes fills up our lives and a great way to do that is by seeking the Lord. But really, truly, seeking him.</p>\\n<p>I'm still working on this. Life can be so absolutely crazy I am thankful for the constant presence of God even when I lack motivation to seek him. That's how much he love us!</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c44PSEridSw86qOy0aIQEWY\",\"title\":\"Confessions of a Seeker of the

am having trouble coming to terms with my radical, conservative, equal rights, homophobic, socialist, universalist, Christian, anti-gun, pro-life, Republican, left-winged, peace-loving, Jesus following, gay-marriage supporting, heterosexual, Bible thumping self.</p>\\n<p>So many thoughts, so many gray areas, so I wait.</p>\\n<p>I wait for guidance from the Father.</p>\\n<p>I wait to act on my beliefs and convictions until I hear and feel the clear voice of Someone omnipotent.</p>\\n<p>Some answers I have received. Some answers seem to change as I mature and expand my horizons. Some answers have not wavered although outside pressures direct me elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>There are red-lettered answers in my Bible. As I read them I can picture Jesus standing in a crowd, teaching his followers with his dirty sandals and unkempt hair. He doesn't notice his appearance because he is more focused on the beggar at the street corner.</p>\\n<p>I desperately want to be like that. I want to look past people's sexual orientations, political persuasions, past-lives, and addictions. I want to see their soul and meet them where they are like Jesus did.</p>\\n<p>I was first introduced to Christianity at a Baptist church. Women were expected to wear skirts and not to say \\\"darn\\\" (too close to the real thing). That's all I knew; and I was taught the most important thing in life is everyone say the ABC prayer before they die.</p>\\n<p>Accept Jesus. Believe he died for you. Confess your sins. BAM. Saved.</p>\\n<p>I developed a fearful and judgmental attitude towards anyone whowas a \\\"non-Christian\\\".</p>\\n<p>I am thankful for that experience because it's where I first stood in the presence of the Lord and that has changed my life. I am thankful to have an understanding of how many conservative Christians think. And I am also thankful to have grown out of that mindset, realizing knowing the Lord is an issue of the heart not a matter of aformula.</p>\\n<p>But now, here I sit, a twenty-something Christian living in modern day America. My heart and mind are torn between tradition, family beliefs, political ideologies, and religion.</p>\\n<p>I love the Lord.</p>\\n<p>I love people.</p>\\n<p>I don't have the same attitude and feelings as some of my family members. And that's okay.</p>\\n<p>I have to admit, one of my guilty pleasures is starting debates with those who have very strong political persuasions. My goal is to convince my father I'm voting for Hilary Clinton. He might not be able to sleep at night, but it's too funny to resist.</p>\\n<p>I'm left with questions: who would Jesus vote for? What would modern-day American Jesus do with his free time? How would he minister?</p>\\n<p>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</p>\\n<p>James 1:27</p>\\n<p>I'm a seeker of the Lord who will keep on seekin'.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c7DxaDgG3WEg6OcAU8s0q6i\",\"title\":\"I, Too, Am America.\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"}],\"slug\":\"i-too-am-america\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/LbvJW3A9CoeQMy6yy6642/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/SPRINGTIME.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/LbvJW3A9CoeQMy6yy6642/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/SPRINGTIME.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/LbvJW3A9CoeQMy6yy6642/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/SPRINGTIME.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/LbvJW3A9CoeQMy6yy6642/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/SPRINGTIME.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/LbvJW3A9CoeQMy6yy6642/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/SPRINGTIME.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/LbvJW3A9CoeQMy6yy6642/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/SPRINGTIME.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/LbvJW3A9CoeQMy6yy6642/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/SPRINGTIME.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/LbvJW3A9CoeQMy6yy6642/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/SPRINGTIME.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"LbvJW3A9CoeQMy6yy6642\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/LbvJW3A9CoeQMy6yy6642/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/SPRINGTIME.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"SPRINGTIME.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>I've been reading the news, watching presidential debates, seeing people's political Facebook statuses, and my heart feels unsettled.</p>\\n<p>People are speaking from a place of fear and not of love. Many are throwing ideas out there like all Muslim's should be deported until further questioning or Muslim immigration should not be allowed. People are making jokes about needing to build a fence to keep the Arabs out and not the Mexicans. Some are spreading anger and wanting to act with un-just violence.</p>\\n<p>Terrorism is real but to say that all Muslims need to be under scrutiny or leave the countryis like saying all adolescent white males who like video games are potentially mass-shooters and we should probably deport them until further notice.</p>\\n<p>If you haven't heard, there have been over 52 school shootings this year. The majority by white, middle-upper class males.</p>\\n<p>That is tragedy. Terrorism is tragedy. This world is full of tragedy. How can we combat this? I don't know. I do know it's not by actingfrom a place of fear or ignorance.</p>\\n<p>Every year in American history there have been racial tensions. Every decade there's a new group that's ostracized and stereotyped.</p>\\n<p>Native Americans were originally considered savages.</p>\\n<p>In 1902 Chinese immigration was made permanently illegal.</p>\\n<p>When Irish immigrants first came to the United States they were ridiculed and forced into slums.</p>\\n<p>In the 1920's Germans were seen as an evil threat, people were afraid they had radical political beliefs and would be the downfall of American society as we knew it. Some were deported, arrested, and probably tortured.</p>\\n<p>Jim Crow laws were practiced from the 1880's until 1965, and African Americans were seen as lesser for centuries. Some people still think this way.</p>\\n<p>Today we are fearful of illegal immigrants who are \\\"stealing our jobs and corrupting our county\\\" because they want a better life for their precious children and can't afford the legal application process. (I met a Guatemalan woman who has applied for a visa for her elderly mother at least three times, each time it was denied. She might not be able to afford to pay to apply again.)</p>\\n<p>Now we want to deport Muslims because we have fear they are weakening our great nation: just like the Native Americans, the Chinese, the Germans, the Blacks.</p>\\n<p>I work with Muslims. I buy groceries from them. I wave to them on the street while we are walking our dogs together. I take Zumba class with Muslim women; we talk about how much we would rather be eating french fries. I see them without their scarves on and feel like I know them in a secret way. They are real people with real lives.</p>\\n<p>I am aware I am not a military strategist. I don't understand all politics and I don't mean to say all people feel this way. I know some who do, and I can assure you know someone like this too. Someone who is acting from fear and not love.</p>\\n<p>We need to do our part to act with love and not give in to the fear and frenzy; that is the goal of terror-ism after all.</p>\\n<p>Find a way to rise above this battle. I believe that's what Jesus would do.</p>\\n<p>This poem was written during the Harlem Renaissance but it still speaks volumes today:</p>\\n<h3>I, Too</h3>\\n<p>BY LANGSTON HUGHES</p>\\n<p>I, too, sing America.\\nI am the darker brother.\\nThey send me to eat in the kitchen\\nWhen company comes,\\nBut I laugh,\\nAnd eat well,\\nAnd grow strong.\\nTomorrow,\\nIll be at the table\\nWhen company comes.\\nNobodyll dare\\nSay to me,\\nEat in the kitchen,\\nThen.\\nBesides,\\nTheyll see how beautiful I am\\nAnd be ashamed\\nI, too, am America.</p>\\n<p>Find the poem <a

can honestly say my marriage is my favorite part of life right now. Maybe one day it will be raising children, owning our own home, who knows what the future holds. Right now my happy place is in my husband's arms. In fact, it's been like that since the day we said \\\"I do\\\".</p>\\n<p>After our wedding ceremony we walked down the aisle and turned the corner to a hallway in our church. There we stole our first moment alone as husband and wife. I remember feeling so thankful, so relieved, and so emotional I just wept into his embrace. It was a moment of pure joy.</p>\\n<p>I get asked at work by students once in a while if I'm married. Always by some rowdy teenage boy (surprise).</p>\\n<p>I say yes I am, and routinely point to my wedding ring. Funny how no one notices! Maybe it's a guy thing. Maybe I need a flashing one or something.</p>\\n<p>Last week this happened again. After explaining the reason for the engagement ring and the wedding band- how they're different and which one you give first- one of the boys asked me if I loved my husband.</p>\\n<p>I said yes, I do love him.</p>\\n<p>No, do you really love him?</p>\\n<p>I said yes, he's a great guy.</p>\\n<p>Then he said do you really think you'll be together forever? Like honestly?</p>\\n<p>First of all, I find it intriguing he wanted to know. I don't know his family history or if he comes from a broken home but I know he told me he never wants to get married.</p>\\n<p>To answer his question, I paused. No one has ever asked me that before.</p>\\n<p>I replied with a yes, I do believe that.</p>\\n<p>He questioned my responsewith a squinting of his eyes and the cocking of his head.</p>\\n<p>The divorce rate is astronomical. Who gets married and truly commits to be together 'til death due you part anymore? It's more like \\\"I commit to you until you stop fulfilling my needs or I simply change my mind.\\\" (I do understand the legitimate need for divorce, especially Biblical reasons such as adultery, etc) However; I hear of MANY couples splitting up over reasons that aren't found in the Bible. Christian and non-Christian couples alike. Life happens, I get it. We make mistakes and we make choices.</p>\\n<p>I've been thinking about this conversation all week. Do I really believe we will be together forever? I'm terrified to commit to anything <strong>FOREVER.</strong></p>\\n<p>What a scary word!</p>\\n<p>What if he hurts my feelings? What if we lose the love and passion? What if I'm no longer physically attracted to him?</p>\\n<p>The answer is I committed myself in front of God and my family. I stood up on a stage in front of my younger siblings, who I would do anything for, as they heard me make a promise. Probably the most serious promise I will ever make in my lifetime; to love and honor this man despite the ebbs and flows of life.</p>\\n<p>We are \\\"young\\\", we are \\\"in love\\\", but we are also <strong>committed, loyal,</strong> and <strong>trusting</strong> in the Lord and his design for our marriage.</p>\\n<p>I hesitate to share these thoughts with all of you because I know marriage and divorce are sensitive subjects for some. I sympathize with all the pain the loss of a marriage uncovers. I have seen it in my family and with my closest friends. Mourning the end of a marriage is like mourning the death of a loved one. Something living, breathing, and sacred dies and the loss is felt in a heavy way. The good news is God brings beauty into all darkness.</p>\\n<p>If I could go back in time and compose a more thoughtful answer to this young man, I would say some of those things.</p>\\n<p>I want him to know that marriage can be beautiful. In fact, it was designed to be <strong>beautiful.</strong> I want him to know how the Lord's love is a great model for love in a marriage. How in forgiveness there is freedom.</p>\\n<p>I wish I could always be prepared with a thoughtful, inspiring, God-filled answer; alas, I am human. Maybe next time.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c7bUrX4VCX6cUmQwgqcSaEO\",\"title\":\"Jesus Gets

haven't written anything in a couple months because I've been tired, stressed, busy, a combination of all those things. Just dealing with life. And a new dog (he is super cute). And a new school year. And laundry.</p>\\n<p>I sometimes forget or neglect to sit down and think about things when I get so wrapped up in life. That's exactly what I needed to do: write, reflect, breathe, share.</p>\\n<p>I'm slightly mad at myself for putting these things off for the past two months but Jesus gets it. He understands. He was there.</p>\\n<p>I've been (very slowly) reading my way through a <a href=\\\"http://sheilawalsh.com/\\\">Sheila Walsh</a> book titled \\\"God Loves Broken People (And Those Who Pretend They're Not)\\\". Every page is juicy and makes me want to share it. I have little bookmarks and folded corners all over the book. Sheila admits she's broken and helps us see that we are too. She strongly emphasizes how the darkness in our souls can open us to the intimacy and love of Jesus we might not have known otherwise. Jesus suffered, he shares in our suffering.</p>\\n<p>\\\"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled,\\\" John 11:33</p>\\n<p>Sheila explains the word 'moved' here is translated from the Greek word 'embrimaomai'. That word is strong and represents anger, strength, or the bellowing and snorting of a horse. Some might say fury. Christ was feeling fury at the pain Mary and Martha were feeling in this situation. She points out that Christ rages with us.</p>\\n<p>How differently would we experience pain if we truly understood that Jesus feels with us?</p>\\n<p>I've been trying to reflect on that over the weekend. I was feeling anxious: Jesus gets it. I was frustrated: Jesus gets it. Jesus was the master of <a href=\\\"http://abovethebattle.com/the-beginning/\\\">rising above the battle.</a></p>\\n<p>God never promised us an easy journey but He did promise us He wins in the end (John 16:33).</p>\\n<p>When we're feeling lost, depressed, anxious, terrified, angry... let's take a moment to remember Jesus gets it. The God of the universe hears you, understands you.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c6hDsNJTy0wMKcaQw4Uk4oe\",\"title\":\"Poetry\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c5ORZhJRBfiwcyiOEMACoGK\",\"category\":\"Depression\"},{\"id\":\"G69JOFlSIogQYAiS0mW0G\",\"category\":\"Emotions\"},{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"}],\"slug\":\"poetry\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.500952380952381,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=400&h=266&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=788&h=525&q=50 788w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=200&h=133&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=400&h=266&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=788&h=525&q=50&fm=webp 788w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png\",\"fileName\":\"poetry.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>My husband and I are youth leaders at our church. This isn't something we necessarily planned; in fact, both of us would say we never desired to work with teenagers. The Lord must have had a plan because we've been leaders for over a year now, and we have fallen in love. Teenagers are complicated. Of course, I never thought I was a complicated or moody teenager- as I'm assuming most of them don't either. Adolescent years are key to discovering who you are, what you believe, and what you really want. I'm constantly being blown away by the depth of knowledge some of our students have. These two poems were written by girls just finishing up eight grade. They haven't experienced many years of life but they have lived through stuff I never hope to. I love these girls and think they have great potential! They shared some poems with me, and I wanted to share them with you:</p>\\n<p>Depression does not always mean beautiful girls shattering at their wrists. A glorified heroic battle for your sanity. Or a father's chance to say his last goodbye.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression is not getting out of bed for three days because your feet refuse to believe that they will not shatter upon impact with the floor.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression means that summoning the will power to go down stairs and do laundry is the most impressive thing you've accomplished all week.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression means lying on the floor staring at the ceiling for hours because you cannot convince your body that it is capable of movement.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression meansnot being able to write for weeks because the only words that you have to offer the world are trapped and drowning and I swear to God I'm trying.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression means that every single bone in your body aches but you have to keep going through the motions.Because you are not aloud to call into work or school 'depressed'.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression means ignoring every phone call for an entire month. Because yes, they have the right number, but you're not the person they're looking for, not anymore.</p>\\n<p>-C.</p>\\n<p>She was lost and broken inside.</p>\\n<p>No one to run to and no where to hide.</p>\\n<p>Someone came along and broke her down, she felt like she was going to drown.</p>\\n<p>Now she's completely done.</p>\\n<p>All she wanted to do was run.</p>\\n<p>Broken home, broken family, all she wanted to do was grow up happily.</p>\\n<p>Chased after a guy, and all he said was lies.</p>\\n<p>Now she has a broken heart, and soon to find someone to turn it into a work of art.</p>\\n<p>All tangled up in depression, and all she needs is another session.</p>\\n<p>Too much emotional pain is making her insane.</p>\\n<p>Prays every night and just wants to take flight into the brightest light.</p>\\n<p>Met a guy over the summer, then had to leave, what a bummer.</p>\\n<p>At her apartment, has too much to drink and needs to think.</p>\\n<p>Collapses to the floor, all of a sudden he busts open the door.</p>\\n<p>Laying in a hospital bed, he thought she was dead.</p>\\n<p>She sees him sitting in the chair, and thought he would never care.</p>\\n<p>He gets up, kisses her forehead, and whispers don't go back to bed.</p>\\n<p>-S.</p>\\n<p>On a side note, I love poetry. I'm not an avid writer or reader, but I often get sucked in. It amazes me how a specific compilation of words can produce such emotion. I know many people who use poetry or spoken word to get things off their chest and to express themselves.

Shocker, right? Well to some people this could be confusing or borderline blasphemous. For others, it's just a conversation starter. Let me explain my journey to this conclusion.</p>\\n<p>About three years ago I was attending a Christian college, I was an RA, and I was trying to pursue my degree in Social Work whole-heartedly. In the midst of college life, my relationship and my understanding of the Lord got pushed to the side. I attended chapel a couple times a week and I was living in a 'good' environment so I didn't pursue the need to expand my understanding of God. I just happened to stumble into a conversation which completely shifted my perspective of him. Some would say coincidence, I say divine planning.</p>\\n<p>I was having lunch with my old boss and I can remember before every meeting I would tell myself 'I don't feel like talking a lot today, I don't want to have deep conversations, I don't want my thoughts and feelings analyzed'. Somehow that never worked out. We always ended up having meaningful conversation and I didn't know it at the time but she taught me a lot about myself and about the Lord.</p>\\n<p>Anyways, we were eating a dry sandwich and some creamy, unhealthy soup. It was a cloudy day. Somehow we got talking about God and all of a sudden I had this revelation. God is NOT a man. It might have been inspired by something I was doing earlier in the day, I can't really remember. But either way, sincethat moment my comprehension of God, of the God of the entire universe, has been shifted.</p>\\n<p>In layman's terms, my mind was blown.</p>\\n<p>I once heard a pastor say, God isnt Gender-less he is Gender-full.</p>\\n<p>Was I allowed to think this? Could I ever share this revelation with other people, or would they think I was a liberal, hippie, feel-good Christian? I've thought a lot about this. And I have come to a conclusion: it's my opinion. I'm going to share my opinion whenever someone wishes to hear it. Simple as that.</p>\\n<p>We try to make God fit our mold. Many artists over the centuries have tried to depict the Lord and I would say the majority of them display him as an old man with a white beard, floating on a cloud. They depict him as towering over us, looking down with all his white-haired wisdom, constantly watching. I realized that is not God. That's not the God I see or I want to see. (Disclaimer* I do fully believe Jesus was a man, that is historically recorded)</p>\\n<p>So, how did this revelation free my mind? I believe our understanding of God changes our relationship with him (or her) ;).</p>\\n<p>I believe by pursuing and seeking the Lord and expanding my understanding, I will also expand my relationship. And it is my personal opinion nothing bad will ever come of expanding our understanding of the Lord and our relationship with him. It's a win-win!</p>\\n<p>Humankind was created as Gods reflection: in the divine image God created them; female and male, God made them.\\\" Genesis 1:27</p>\\n<p>We were created in God's image! God's image is both female and male. Interesting... huh?</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c2G18fIbb8cqEGwKkKc0aog\",\"title\":\"Reminder: Not All Stress is Bad Stress\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"}],\"slug\":\"reminder-not-all-stress-is-bad-stress\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2yAbgl5ZWQUcskaESc40aC/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TODAY.png\",\"fileName\":\"TODAY.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>One thing i've learned about myself over the past few years; I'm afraid of stress. Any hint of stress in my body or my mind makes me feel weak and stupid. Somewhere deep down inside I feel like I should be able to handle anything, everything. Maybe it's because for long period of my life I did. I handled everything. I handled things beyond what I should have or what I needed to. It was my way of creating peace out of the chaos around me.</p>\\n<p>I just started a new job, this week in fact. I started a whole new career, in a whole new place, and on a whole new time schedule. Last week I felt some stress about it- but not as much as I probably needed to allow myself to feel.</p>\\n<p>This is how it happens...</p>\\n<p>My heart race picks up slowly, my body temperature rises slightly, and then the fear sets in.</p>\\n<p>Oh no, it's happening. I must be stressed about something.</p>\\n<p>My heart races faster. I feel glimpses of panic.</p>\\n<p>And then come the thoughts; I can't handle anything, how am I going to get through this new week, why do I put myself through so much stress... you get the picture.</p>\\n<p>The issue here is, stress is okay! It's a natural part of life-especially when you're starting a new job or a new chapter of your life. Stress can be used for positive motivation. Fight or flight. It helps us get things done and gain motivation when we feel like we have none. Some pressure can be good!</p>\\n<p>That's something I have to constantly remind myself: It's okay to feel stress. Not all stress is bad stress. Feeling stress is not a sign of weakness.</p>\\n<p>On the car ride to my new job at 6:30 am I began to feel a little panic rise up somewhere from my gut. Thankfully, I realized what was hapening and took some nice deep breaths. Then I prayed- gave it all over to God. When I give my stress to God, there's nothing left to call my own and beat myself up for. It's something I do to try and be more kind to myself.</p>\\n<p>Day two of the new job, I felt stress trying to get through all of my errands after work and still fit in exercise and dinner somewhere. I took a lot of deep breaths that day. Day three, thought I was having a severe allergic reaction to my breakfast on the way to work. I was eating toast. Toast! I took a lot of deep breaths that morning too.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say, I'm still learning to allow stress in my life. And I'm learning to forgive myself when I forget. Do you allow a little good stress in your life?</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c6daDjGiVoWMeGgs6wSQiao\",\"title\":\"Why We Need a Source of Peace\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"},{\"id\":\"c1UGVSypiscCcEM6OMmSIKw\",\"category\":\"Peace\"}],\"slug\":\"why-we-need-a-source-of-peace\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=560&h=560&q=50 560w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png?w=560&h=560&q=50&fm=webp 560w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2d70GYBf44w6GGGQa0QCWw/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/TodayithankGod.png\",\"fileName\":\"TodayithankGod.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Life is hard. Awful things happen. Any illusion of control we have over our lives is just that- an illusion. This can cause stress, worry, anxiety, depression, anger, and just basic fear. I have experienced all of those due to my illusion of control. My greatest source of strength and peace has come from my higher power, Jesus Christ. Whether you are a Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, my goal is not to convert you. My goal is to share with you the necessity of having a power greater than ourselves to bring peace and strength.</p>\\n<p>Life wasn't made to be lived alone. I believe that means spiritually and physically. We need other people in our lives; we need our friends, family, spouse, dog, whatever. We also need to nourish our spiritual selves and realize we aren't created to be alone spiritually either. We aren't souls floating on this planet for no concrete reason and without a purpose. There is a God out there who wants to dwell in us and is just jumping at the chance to bring us peace.</p>\\n<p>Jesus gives me peace.</p>\\n<p>He has been my source of strength and my only source of hope through this whole journey. The only thing that kept me going when I was at my worst was the knowledge that God knew my pain. If he knew my pain I had to believe he had a plan. And from my experience God always turns ugliness into beauty. He truly does make all things beautiful (Ecclesiastes 3:11). But in his time, not ours. I wanted healing right away. I wanted to go to sleep and wake up the next day fully restored to my old self- whatever that felt like. After a couple weeks of that not happening, actually seeming worse, I realized I had to surrender to Gods timing. It didn't happen in one big moment. It happened hundreds of times. Every hour. Sometimes every five minutes. It's still happening.</p>\\n<p>I don't know how anyone can't get through life without faith in God. Faith in a higher power. Faith in someone or something that loves us and has a plan and a purpose for our lives. I don't understand the mystery of Christ but I do believe. The spirit of God is alive in my life and that's the only way I can explain it.</p>\\n<p>This Easter was more significant for me than in Year's past. Ihad the chance toreally reflect on the last week of Jesus' life. I tried to picture him in the garden praying to God the day before he knew he was going to die. I tried to picture the weight of the world's sin and guilt hanging on his shoulders. Every amount of shame and guilt I have ever felt, he carried. I tried to wrap my mind around the sacrifice of his life for us. I can't figure it out. But I believe it. I believe in his love.</p>\\n<p>Today I thank God for giving me his peace.</p>\\n<p>Where does your peace come from?</p>\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{\"category\":\"Faith\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/categories-faith.json\n// module id = 328\n// module chunks = 213712190061452"],"sourceRoot":""}
