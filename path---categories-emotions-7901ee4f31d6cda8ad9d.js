night when I am awoken by little hunger cries I roll out of bed, grab my sweater and head down the nightlight-lit hall to the nursery. I look down at the little boy wincing in his bassinet, pick him up, and gently kiss him on his forehead. In complete silence, with exception of his white noise machine, I change his diaper, re-swaddle, head to the rocking chair, and begin to nurse him back to comfort. We sit by the glow of Christmas lights. Just the two of us.</p>\n<p>We're still getting to know each other.</p>\n<p>He recognizes the sound of my voice and the smell of my skin. He just started turning his head towards me when I speak.</p>\n<p>I am learning the meaning of his different cries. The hunger cries, the painful cries, the cries of boredom, and the desire for comfort.</p>\n<p>When we first brought him home I didn't know if I could do it. I couldn't soothe him every time he fussed. I wasn't sure if he was hungry, uncomfortable, scared. My body hurt from the c-section and the drop in hormone levels left me with a floodgate of tears and nervousness.My husband and Iheard phantom cries every time we went into a different room and sometimes took turns outside with the dog just to get a break from the crying.</p>\n<p>During our first week together in the middle of the night I was rocking my son for what seemed like hours. He wasn't crying but wasn't sleeping either. I was so tired; my lower back was aching from holding him in the same position, afraid that if I moved him he would never fall asleep. Then I caught a glimpse of our silhouette in the bedroom mirror. I could see the outline of my messy hair and bad posture. In my arms I was holding a baby. My baby. My child.</p>\n<p>This is me, this is my identity now. Mother. It's my duty and purpose to be awake in the early hours of the morning rocking our son;could this be real? My reflection confirms my thoughts.</p>\n<p>Every night I pass the mirror and see myself with a baby in my arms. Sometimes I just stop and stare... is that really me? Is this really us? It's like I want to seal the memory in my mind. It's a sacred moment, my son and me together in the dark.</p>\n<p>Every day we learn a little more and life gets a little easier. Nothing is perfect but everything we are experiencing is perfectly human. I am thankful.</p>"}}},{id:"tOQlNA9lyoskcoUgqMEqm",title:"Between Life & Death",createdAt:"February 20, 2018",featuredImage:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,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",aspectRatio:1,src:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&q=50",srcSet:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w",srcWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp",srcSetWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w",sizes:"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"},id:"c3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E",file:{url:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png",fileName:"052819-1.png",contentType:"image/png"}},content:{childMarkdownRemark:{html:"<p>I'm sitting here on my balcony looking at the last little triangle of sunlight shining on a tree as it sets behind us.

Grandma is dying.</p>\n<p>It's hard to live life when there's so much good and so much bad.</p>\n<p>Living between anticipated new life and anticipated death is a weird space.

All I know is that I'm caught in a gray area- dark gray. That means it's time to pray.</p>\n<p>There are five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. I keep wondering if I'm in this cycle. Is there a stage called confusion? That seems more accurate. All those other feelings come and go. Who invented this formula for grief? How can anyone decide who experiences what? Maybe some people can't get past the depression; that is frightening. Maybe some people slip right into acceptance because their faith is so strong they know who is in control. I want that. I want so much trust in the Lord nothing so \"normal\" as life and death could shake me.</p>\n<p>Alas, I am reminded of my humanness.

It's like the darkness has a mind of it's own- it comes when it's unwelcome and stays until one day, it just lifts. Maybe for you it never lifts. I pray the Lord takes that from you.</p>\n<p>What has given me hope and what can give you hope is knowing someone who has overcome. I have friends and role models who have overcome depression. You never really get over it because an experience like that changes you. But you do feel better. Nothing lasts forever.</p>\n<p>I have a precious friend who had a nasty bout with anxiety and depression. She had a really positive experience with her medication and felt like a new woman; restored to her old self and possibly even feeling better than ever. Recently some old symptoms crept back up and she contacted me. She thought she was cured. I also wanted to be 'cured'. But there is no such thing from my experience. We are who we are, we struggle the way we struggle, and we learn to move on and upwards <a href=\"http://abovethebattle.com/the-beginning/\">above the battle.</a></p>\n<p>Hard times change us forever. Do we really want to be cured? Sometimes we wish we could forget it all. But our struggles make us who we are and we are stronger because of them. I am learning every day to be thankful for the hardest summer of my life because I've been able to help and reach out to so many friends like me. It's such a blessing when God turns the ugly into the beautiful.</p>\n<p>\"If you're going through hell, keep going.\" -Winston Churchill</p>\n<p>I came across this video about a year ago and found it really encouraging. First of all, this girl's voice is awesome. Secondly, she is proof that through self-care and determination, we can overcome.</p>\n<p><a

am having trouble coming to terms with my radical, conservative, equal rights, homophobic, socialist, universalist, Christian, anti-gun, pro-life, Republican, left-winged, peace-loving, Jesus following, gay-marriage supporting, heterosexual, Bible thumping self.</p>\n<p>So many thoughts, so many gray areas, so I wait.</p>\n<p>I wait for guidance from the Father.</p>\n<p>I wait to act on my beliefs and convictions until I hear and feel the clear voice of Someone omnipotent.</p>\n<p>Some answers I have received. Some answers seem to change as I mature and expand my horizons. Some answers have not wavered although outside pressures direct me elsewhere.</p>\n<p>There are red-lettered answers in my Bible. As I read them I can picture Jesus standing in a crowd, teaching his followers with his dirty sandals and unkempt hair. He doesn't notice his appearance because he is more focused on the beggar at the street corner.</p>\n<p>I desperately want to be like that. I want to look past people's sexual orientations, political persuasions, past-lives, and addictions. I want to see their soul and meet them where they are like Jesus did.</p>\n<p>I was first introduced to Christianity at a Baptist church. Women were expected to wear skirts and not to say \"darn\" (too close to the real thing). That's all I knew; and I was taught the most important thing in life is everyone say the ABC prayer before they die.</p>\n<p>Accept Jesus. Believe he died for you. Confess your sins. BAM. Saved.</p>\n<p>I developed a fearful and judgmental attitude towards anyone whowas a \"non-Christian\".</p>\n<p>I am thankful for that experience because it's where I first stood in the presence of the Lord and that has changed my life. I am thankful to have an understanding of how many conservative Christians think. And I am also thankful to have grown out of that mindset, realizing knowing the Lord is an issue of the heart not a matter of aformula.</p>\n<p>But now, here I sit, a twenty-something Christian living in modern day America. My heart and mind are torn between tradition, family beliefs, political ideologies, and religion.</p>\n<p>I love the Lord.</p>\n<p>I love people.</p>\n<p>I don't have the same attitude and feelings as some of my family members. And that's okay.</p>\n<p>I have to admit, one of my guilty pleasures is starting debates with those who have very strong political persuasions. My goal is to convince my father I'm voting for Hilary Clinton. He might not be able to sleep at night, but it's too funny to resist.</p>\n<p>I'm left with questions: who would Jesus vote for? What would modern-day American Jesus do with his free time? How would he minister?</p>\n<p>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</p>\n<p>James 1:27</p>\n<p>I'm a seeker of the Lord who will keep on seekin'.</p>"}}},{id:"c3wzTVOZhfWSweeIIgAWMoW",title:"Save Your Venom",createdAt:"February 20, 2018",featuredImage:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1,src:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&q=50",srcSet:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w",srcWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp",srcSetWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w",sizes:"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"},id:"c1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU",file:{url:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg",fileName:"happy-new-year.jpg",contentType:"image/jpeg"}},content:{childMarkdownRemark:{html:"<p>Since I got an iPhone last year, I've been pretty obsessed with podcasts. My current favorites are Serial and Heather Dubrow's World. I listen to them every week while I walk the dog, drive in the car, or go to the gym. Earlier this week I was listening once again as I happily worked out on the spin bike (okay fine, I was sweating profusely and constantly staring at the 30 minute timer willing it to end). Anyways, I heard a podcast with and the featured guest was <a href=\"http://kristiling.com/\">Kristi Ling</a>, the happiness strategist. I really don't like the word 'happy' because it's such a fluffy word. It just sounds so shallow to me.</p>\n<p>Everyone wants to be happy, find their happiness, find someone to make them happy.</p>\n<p>When I heard this lady who is an expert on happiness was coming on to the show I wasn't expecting much...honestly. However, she had great points and great ideas- I was so inspired I decided to write about it. I actually, perhaps, maybe, will consider buying her newest book.</p>\n<p>Kristi Ling wears a rattlesnake ring every day. Kind of a weird piece of jewelry if you ask me. For her, it's a daily reminder to 'save her venom'.</p>\n<p>Rattlesnakes have very poisonous venom. They need it to kill their prey so they can eat and survive. If approached by a threat, the snake will not strike. They wait until they are absolutely sure their very life is being threatened. Why? They need to save their venom! If they don't preserve their supply, they won't have it when they really need it. It's a waste.</p>\n<p>I LOVE THIS ANALOGY.</p>\n<p>I need to save my venom! It so perfectly relates to those struggling with anxiety. We get so anxious and freaked out by what-ifs all the time. Our fight or flight responses kick in and we go into hyper drive. For me, it doesn't matter if there is a real dangerous threat, my venom is ready to strike at any hint of fear.</p>\n<p>The other day I was driving in the car and started to become consumed with worry that my car would break down and I would have no way to get to work. I started thinking about how we would pay for repairs, could we afford a new car, would Jacob be able to drive me to work in the morning?</p>\n<p>Then I paused and remembered the rattlesnake. I want to be a rattlesnake. I want to save my venom. And that's exactly what happened.</p>\n<p>I realized how much I was panicking about something that wasn't happening. <strong>I was wasting my time and thought energy on a hypothetical situation when the reality was everything was fine.</strong></p>\n<p>I love this analogy so much I considered getting my own rattlesnake ring as a reminder.

Fear of death, fear of isolation, fear of no control, fear of the feeling lasting forever. Those are some of the things I've experienced. The most helpful 'tool in my toolbox' (a phrase my Grandmother uses) to help me through a panic attack is <strong>knowledge.</strong></p>\n<p>My first anxiety attack was by far the worst because I had no idea what was going on. I literally thought I was going crazy. Today through learning, reading, talking, sharing, I am able to successfully talk myself out of a full-blown panic attack on most occasions.</p>\n<p>It's uncomfortable for me to admit this but yes, I experienced an more-intense-than-usual anxiety attack a little while ago. I still struggle with this. They always sneak up out of nowhere, don't they?</p>\n<p>In the midst of the chaos, I realized I was talking to myself (in my head, don't worry). Once I came to this epiphany, that I did actually know what was going on with my body and why it was happening, I was so excited! How cool is it to learn new things about yourself?</p>\n<p>Everything seems less scary to me when I understand it. <strong>Knowledge is power.</strong></p>\n<p>After the event dissipated I immediately started writing my thought process down. I knew I had to share it and perhaps you'll be able to learn something new and become more successful at talking yourself through scary moments.</p>\n<p>Please observe,</p>\n<p><strong>How to talk yourself through a panic attack:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Understand what is going on with your body. When you experience a panic attack or feel that initial rush of adrenaline, your neurotransmitters in your brain are firing like crazy. Sometimes they don't calm down quite as they should, and your body thinks it's in immediate danger. Sometimes this happens out of nowhere, with no observable trigger. This is why it's called an \"attack\". Pause and realize what's going on. Talk to your neurotransmitters- become friends with them!</li>\n<li>Realizing you CAN still breathe. Take. Deep. Breaths.</li>\n<li>Nothing lasts forever. Even this unbearable feeling. You may have to repeat this out loud. \"I am okay, I am okay, I am okay.\"</li>\n<li>I'm not alone, you're not alone.</li>\n<li>Be kind to yourself. You are not weak, you are not lesser.</li>\n<li>Understand your triggers if they exist. Try to figure out what triggers your panic and think about why.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's no secret holidays cause stress. No matter how hard I try to remain calm, it has yet to happen. Between family tensions and holiday shopping, there is a lot of pressure.</p>\n<p>I might experience some panic, maybe you will too. With some practice we will be able to fight the anxiety and talk ourselves down and be able to spend more time reflecting on the reason for the season rather than in our own heads.</p>\n<p>Merry Christmas xox</p>"}}},{id:"c6A6nxW4B7am62ksiaUs440",title:"You're Worth It",createdAt:"February 19, 2018",featuredImage:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,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",aspectRatio:1,src:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1TBS3cyaxCU4imaGUwkaIo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/no-sleepin-thecity.png?w=800&q=50",srcSet:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1TBS3cyaxCU4imaGUwkaIo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/no-sleepin-thecity.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1TBS3cyaxCU4imaGUwkaIo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/no-sleepin-thecity.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1TBS3cyaxCU4imaGUwkaIo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/no-sleepin-thecity.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w",srcWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1TBS3cyaxCU4imaGUwkaIo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/no-sleepin-thecity.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp",srcSetWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1TBS3cyaxCU4imaGUwkaIo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/no-sleepin-thecity.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1TBS3cyaxCU4imaGUwkaIo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/no-sleepin-thecity.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1TBS3cyaxCU4imaGUwkaIo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/no-sleepin-thecity.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w",sizes:"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"},id:"c1TBS3cyaxCU4imaGUwkaIo",file:{url:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1TBS3cyaxCU4imaGUwkaIo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/no-sleepin-thecity.png",fileName:"no-sleepin-thecity.png",contentType:"image/png"}},content:{childMarkdownRemark:{html:"<p>What do you do when you have more bad days than good days? I know my last post said 'you're having a bad day, you don't have a bad life'. I believe that's true but what do we do when we don't feel like that? What do we do when we feel like we have the worst life ever? What do we do when the weight of the world is pressing so heavily on our shoulders it's almost hard to breathe?

That was the first time I had sang anything or even wanted to attempt to make any joyful noise come out of my mouth in a long time.

Not in a \"I'm confused about who I am\" sorta way. It just seems simpler. No monthly gift where your uterus tortures you for not being pregnant, no shaving your legs, no messing with your crazy bed-head for twenty minutes before work, no make up, blah blah blah. In my experience, men also have less anxiety overall and an easier time dealing with stress. Disclaimer: I realize this is a very over generalized statement, and some men do struggle with intense anxiety. Just not too many of the men I know.</p>\n<p>With the exception of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), women have twice the risk for most anxiety disorders as men.</p>\n<p>That's science. You can't argue with science. As a woman, I am at twice the risk for an anxiety disorder as any man. Lucky me! I won the anxiety disorder lottery. I sometimes ask my husband how he deals with stress. His usual response is, \"I just don't think about it. Then it goes away,\". Oh how I wonder what that would be like! It almost makes me angry with him. What do you mean you just don't think about it? Don't you worry about all the hundreds of things I worry about every day? How can you just fall fast asleep when you know there's three loads of laundry just waiting in the hamper and no groceries in the fridge?</p>\n<p>I have learned from him. It's like we were made for each other. We balance each other well- I thank the Lord every day for that.</p>\n<p>I am a woman, and I am learning to embrace everything that comes with that title. Emotions, hormones, anxiety, femininity. It's all beautiful.</p>\n<p>When my husband and I were dating we read two books called \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Women-Only-Revised-Updated-Edition/dp/1601424442/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_y\">For Women Only</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601424450/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=1944687682&#x26;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&#x26;pf_rd_t=201&#x26;pf_rd_i=1590523172&#x26;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&#x26;pf_rd_r=1STM30EC0D16PD0EDEW5\">For Men Only</a>\" by Shaunti Feldhahn and her husband Jeff Feldhahn. THESE BOOKS ARE AMAZING. We cannot stress that enough. It provides insight into the opposite gender's head you didn't even know existed. There are sections on love, intimacy, communication, and even stress. The area that talked about stress and worry was one of my favorites. I'm always looking for clear and concise ways to express to my husband how my mind works, and when I can find a professional clearly explain my thinking process, that's so incredibly helpful.</p>\n<p>Shaunti and Jeff describe women's minds by using the illustration of computer windows. Women have tons and tons of windows open. Each window represents a thought, worry, concern, etc. \"Women's thought lives are like busy computers with multiple windows open and all running at once,\".</p>\n<p>When a women in the book was asked, how do you operate with all those thoughts going on in your head at once? Why don't you just concentrate on one thing and turn all the other windows off?</p>\n<p>Her response, \"Because I can't. And even if I did, they'd come back,\".</p>\n<p>Can you ladies relate to that? I sure can. In a man's mind, they don't understand why we can't just close the windows. It's as simple as that, duh. Sorry guys... us women weren't wired that way. Women are shown to be unable to close their windows and \"<a href=\"http://abovethebattle.com/just-try-not-to-think-about-it/\">just not think about it</a>\"the way men can.</p>\n<p>In fact, in the \"For Women Only Book\", there isn't even a sectiondevoted to windows or worry thoughts.

This isn't something we necessarily planned; in fact, both of us would say we never desired to work with teenagers. The Lord must have had a plan because we've been leaders for over a year now, and we have fallen in love. Teenagers are complicated. Of course, I never thought I was a complicated or moody teenager- as I'm assuming most of them don't either. Adolescent years are key to discovering who you are, what you believe, and what you really want. I'm constantly being blown away by the depth of knowledge some of our students have. These two poems were written by girls just finishing up eight grade. They haven't experienced many years of life but they have lived through stuff I never hope to. I love these girls and think they have great potential! They shared some poems with me, and I wanted to share them with you:</p>\n<p>Depression does not always mean beautiful girls shattering at their wrists. A glorified heroic battle for your sanity. Or a father's chance to say his last goodbye.</p>\n<p>Sometimes depression is not getting out of bed for three days because your feet refuse to believe that they will not shatter upon impact with the floor.</p>\n<p>Sometimes depression means that summoning the will power to go down stairs and do laundry is the most impressive thing you've accomplished all week.</p>\n<p>Sometimes depression means lying on the floor staring at the ceiling for hours because you cannot convince your body that it is capable of movement.</p>\n<p>Sometimes depression meansnot being able to write for weeks because the only words that you have to offer the world are trapped and drowning and I swear to God I'm trying.</p>\n<p>Sometimes depression means that every single bone in your body aches but you have to keep going through the motions.Because you are not aloud to call into work or school 'depressed'.</p>\n<p>Sometimes depression means ignoring every phone call for an entire month. Because yes, they have the right number, but you're not the person they're looking for, not anymore.</p>\n<p>-C.</p>\n<p>She was lost and broken inside.</p>\n<p>No one to run to and no where to hide.</p>\n<p>Someone came along and broke her down, she felt like she was going to drown.</p>\n<p>Now she's completely done.</p>\n<p>All she wanted to do was run.</p>\n<p>Broken home, broken family, all she wanted to do was grow up happily.</p>\n<p>Chased after a guy, and all he said was lies.</p>\n<p>Now she has a broken heart, and soon to find someone to turn it into a work of art.</p>\n<p>All tangled up in depression, and all she needs is another session.</p>\n<p>Too much emotional pain is making her insane.</p>\n<p>Prays every night and just wants to take flight into the brightest light.</p>\n<p>Met a guy over the summer, then had to leave, what a bummer.</p>\n<p>At her apartment, has too much to drink and needs to think.</p>\n<p>Collapses to the floor, all of a sudden he busts open the door.</p>\n<p>Laying in a hospital bed, he thought she was dead.</p>\n<p>She sees him sitting in the chair, and thought he would never care.</p>\n<p>He gets up, kisses her forehead, and whispers don't go back to bed.</p>\n<p>-S.</p>\n<p>On a side note, I love poetry. I'm not an avid writer or reader, but I often get sucked in. It amazes me how a specific compilation of words can produce such emotion. I know many people who use poetry or spoken word to get things off their chest and to express themselves.
