This isn't something we necessarily planned; in fact, both of us would say we never desired to work with teenagers. The Lord must have had a plan because we've been leaders for over a year now, and we have fallen in love. Teenagers are complicated. Of course, I never thought I was a complicated or moody teenager- as I'm assuming most of them don't either. Adolescent years are key to discovering who you are, what you believe, and what you really want. I'm constantly being blown away by the depth of knowledge some of our students have. These two poems were written by girls just finishing up eight grade. They haven't experienced many years of life but they have lived through stuff I never hope to. I love these girls and think they have great potential! They shared some poems with me, and I wanted to share them with you:</p>\n<p>Depression does not always mean beautiful girls shattering at their wrists. A glorified heroic battle for your sanity. Or a father's chance to say his last goodbye.</p>\n<p>Sometimes depression is not getting out of bed for three days because your feet refuse to believe that they will not shatter upon impact with the floor.</p>\n<p>Sometimes depression means that summoning the will power to go down stairs and do laundry is the most impressive thing you've accomplished all week.</p>\n<p>Sometimes depression means lying on the floor staring at the ceiling for hours because you cannot convince your body that it is capable of movement.</p>\n<p>Sometimes depression meansnot being able to write for weeks because the only words that you have to offer the world are trapped and drowning and I swear to God I'm trying.</p>\n<p>Sometimes depression means that every single bone in your body aches but you have to keep going through the motions.Because you are not aloud to call into work or school 'depressed'.</p>\n<p>Sometimes depression means ignoring every phone call for an entire month. Because yes, they have the right number, but you're not the person they're looking for, not anymore.</p>\n<p>-C.</p>\n<p>She was lost and broken inside.</p>\n<p>No one to run to and no where to hide.</p>\n<p>Someone came along and broke her down, she felt like she was going to drown.</p>\n<p>Now she's completely done.</p>\n<p>All she wanted to do was run.</p>\n<p>Broken home, broken family, all she wanted to do was grow up happily.</p>\n<p>Chased after a guy, and all he said was lies.</p>\n<p>Now she has a broken heart, and soon to find someone to turn it into a work of art.</p>\n<p>All tangled up in depression, and all she needs is another session.</p>\n<p>Too much emotional pain is making her insane.</p>\n<p>Prays every night and just wants to take flight into the brightest light.</p>\n<p>Met a guy over the summer, then had to leave, what a bummer.</p>\n<p>At her apartment, has too much to drink and needs to think.</p>\n<p>Collapses to the floor, all of a sudden he busts open the door.</p>\n<p>Laying in a hospital bed, he thought she was dead.</p>\n<p>She sees him sitting in the chair, and thought he would never care.</p>\n<p>He gets up, kisses her forehead, and whispers don't go back to bed.</p>\n<p>-S.</p>\n<p>On a side note, I love poetry. I'm not an avid writer or reader, but I often get sucked in. It amazes me how a specific compilation of words can produce such emotion. I know many people who use poetry or spoken word to get things off their chest and to express themselves. Anyone want to share some more with me?</p>"}}}},pathContext:{slug:"poetry"}}}});
