In the midst of college life, my relationship and my understanding of the Lord got pushed to the side.

Somehow that never worked out. We always ended up having meaningful conversation and I didn't know it at the time but she taught me a lot about myself and about the Lord.</p>\\n<p>Anyways, we were eating a dry sandwich and some creamy, unhealthy soup.

Many artists over the centuries have tried to depict the Lord and I would say the majority of them display him as an old man with a white beard, floating on a cloud.
