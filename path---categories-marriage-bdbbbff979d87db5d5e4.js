due date was Monday, November fourteenth. I woke up and went to work just like any other day- except this day I was hoping to not return home. I had hopes for a natural birth. The doctors told me I was young and healthy, this was going to be great. I kept telling my coworkers I thought my water was going to break; a woman just knows when somethings not 'normal' down there. Late into the night I got into bed and felt a warm gush... just like the doctor said I would. Then we were off! I was so incredibly excited yet calm. We texted, called, and emailed family and coworkers. Life was about to change and I just had no idea what to expect.</p>\n<p>We parked in the parking garage and I felt a sense of pride that I could still walk around, although I was definitely leaving a mess behind. My husband made me ride in a wheelchair, which was probably the best idea. He's good at being kind to me.</p>\n<p>The hospital was eerily quiet, but it was two in the morning. No contractions started so the doctors had me pacing the hallways in my fancy hospital socks. One hour, two hours, nothing. And then came my first unexpected blow: we need to induce you. Sorry, you're not progressing.</p>\n<p>Five hours later and still less than halfway dilated. My heart dropped to the floor when the doctor (the first of three) told me this was going to be an evening baby and the sun had barely just risen. I had no energy left at this point. Then came unexpected blow number two: I asked for the epidural.</p>\n<p>Time passed in a haze as I lay in the hospital bed, contracting but barely feeling anything but a heaviness, listening to a repeating soundtrack my husband put on as a distraction. People kept bringing him food; I was beyond envious he didn't have to live through the day like I did.</p>\n<p>Late into the evening there was a doctor, a nurse, two nurse interns, and my husband all in the room when my doctor said the biggest unexpected blow number three: you might want to consider a c-section at this point. Baby is not dropping and you seem to not be dilated beyond eight centimeters. That's when the tears came. And the vomit. Did I mention all the vomit? They said it was the medication, lack of food, hormones... either way it sucked. I was so desperate for relief and afraid the baby would never come so I said yes. And I don't regret my decision, I just feel sad for the way I experienced it.</p>\n<p>I remember telling Jacob in the hospital that I was never having another baby. We were adopting. That is that. Everyone said I would change my mind... but I think i'm still working through the trauma of it all. We want Eli to have a sibling: to learn how to share and live in community. I just don't know if I can handle that experience again. When you battle anxiety and depression, mixed with wacky hormones, throw in an unexpected emergency surgery, oh and a real life baby: you get fear. I have lived with fear since the moment he was born. Please don't misunderstand, I have joy. I love that child more than I love myself. But there is a degree of fear underlying my thoughts I can't quite put my finger on.</p>\n<p>Today and every day I try to live in the present. I try to hold him and rock him to sleep and not to rush this time of life together. I pray, I ask for guidance, call the doctor all the time, and try not to take myself too seriously.</p>\n<p>We sure did get lucky with a baby who still smiles at me even though he can't breathe out of his nose right now. My grandma told me he was going to bring a lot of joy into our lives and she was correct. Despite my fear, despite my uncertainty, he is teaching me to just sit there and giggle with him.</p>\n<p>Welcome to this crazy world Eli William!</p>"}}},{id:"c6dfXLxkndK8g4osEywauG0",title:"My

honor of my husband's birthday this month I want to reflect a bit on our marriage,our sweet love story, and what I've learned through relationship.</p>\n<p>I write this in almost every wedding card we give: <strong>Marriage is my favorite part of life right now.</strong> It's so amazing to live with your best friend, wake up to him every morning, cook with him or for him, hold hands, and live life knowing you have someone who fully supports and loves you. Some say, \"you're still in the honeymoon phase, just wait ten years\". We've heard that one before. Or, \"oh, it won't last\". Let me preface this post with some disclaimers and insights into my life.</p>\n<p>First, I am not a marriage expert and would never claim to be. I am just blessed to be in a great marriage that honors the Lord and has a strong foundation. Secondly, while we've only been married less than three years, Jacob and I have been together almost six years and friends for nine years. I do believe the time spent together and growing together has given me tremendous knowledge about relationship. Lastly, our relationship is not without conflict. We spent the first two years of dating fighting almost on a weekly basis. Tears, angry phone calls, lack of trust, you name it. Long distance isn't the easiest. Conflict is included in my definition of a healthy relationship. In fact, the other day we gave each other the silent treatment for over an hour... it happens. It's only how you grow through the conflict that matters. I realize now I am writing this post as much for myself as for others. I need these remindersto look back on when life gets tough; when my anxiety levels rise and I need direction.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I do not believe the naysayers who claim love doesn't last, the honeymoon phase can't possibly last. I know too many people who are in strong committed relationships after ten, twenty, thirty years. In fact, I'm completely excited to grow old together. I want to be with him when our kids graduate high school, when we retire from work. I want to take care of him if he ever gets sick; live up to my vows through sickness and in health. It is my hope that through our relationship we can grow as individuals and be an example of the Lord's love on earth.</p>\n<p>Since the moment I met Jacob when I was 15 (he was a cool college kid by then), I felt something special. We had an instant connection. He was attracted to my, let's say, beauty. And I just thought he was a goofy kid I loved to be around. It didn't take long for us to develop feelings for each other but life got in the way: other relationships, school, my fear of boys, and even family. I always knew somehow we'd end up together- soul mates? Who knows.</p>\n<p>My friends would see us interact at college and constantly told me he was in love with me. I brushed it off. My grandmother sensed his affection for me and knew it was strong, I wasn't ready to hear it. I avoided Jacob when he started writing me letters and wanting to spend more time together. It was too real, too fast. Then he had a dream.</p>\n<p>I really do believe God can speak through our dreams and this is a great example. He had a dream about me, and he took that as a sign it might be time to pursue more than a friendship. And for the first time in years I didn't completely resist him.</p>\n<p>I credit Jacob for the traditional-ness of our relationship. I can't think of any other way to say it but he always tries to do the right thing. He asked my dad if he could date me, he waited patiently until I was ready, he didn't kiss me for almost three months after we started dating,and asked me if he could kiss me one night under the stars. He stressed respect, physical boundaries, communication, and honesty. I'm not sure how he got so wise but I have learned more from him about relationships than any book, sermon, tv show, or friend. To my wonderful mother and father in law, if you're reading this, you did something right!</p>\n<p><strong>Six things I've learned from marriage:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is a reflection of the Lord's love and grace for us. It is through my marriage I've come to a deeper understanding of grace and forgiveness. Through marriage we can show the world God's design for family and relationship. It is through marriage we practice the love of the Lord on earth and show others that by His strength we can endure hardships. I've needed a lot of grace from Jacob over the years. I have struggles and he has struggles. By requiring so much grace and love from him I believe I've learned better how to give it and also receive it from the Lord.</li>\n<li>My husband is loved by God. He is a child of God. I once heard a preacher say when you get married, God also becomes your father-in-law. Your spouse first belonged to the Lord and they are still cherished by their heavenly father. That really puts it into perspective for me. I love and value my spouse but God loves and values them more than I could ever understand. This principle is true for everyone in our lives, not just our spouses.</li>\n<li>Love is a decision. I'm sure you've heard that before... but do you know its depth? Love is a commitment and a commitment I have to learn to choose even on the hard days. I have to choose to respond in love when all I want to do is scream and yell at Jacob and tell him how many ways he messed up. I have to choose to respond in love when he confesses something to me that hurts my feelings. I have to stick on love's side when he tells me how I've hurt him or ways I could grow as a person. Sometimes I don't respond in love right away. Sometimes I have to come back an hour or a day later and apologize for what I said or didn't say. That's the beauty of grace and forgiveness. We are both imperfect in our imperfect-ness. Commitmentis the only way love works.</li>\n<li>Marriage is stinkin' hard but it's so unbelievably worth it. Life is not meant to be lived alone. We were created for our partner and our partner was created for us. If you're not married or don't plan on getting married, then switch the word 'marriage' with 'relationship'. Relationships can be so difficult but we were created for community!</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The person who tries to live alone will not succeed as a human being. His heart withers if it does not answer another heart. His mind shrinks away if he hears only the echoes of his own thoughts and finds no other inspiration. -Pearl S. Buck</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>We are both our own person. We were Jacob and Ashley, two distinctly unique human beings before we were married, and we are those same people today. Jacob has his own desires, wants, talents, and so do I. I do not own him. I cannot change him. He cannot make me fit any mold. We are who we are individually and together; and together we create something really special when we allow each other to be our own.</li>\n<li>No other human being will ever fill the hole in my heart. C.S. Lewis referred to it as a 'God shaped hole'. It's so unfair for me to expect my husband to meet all my needs and fill every gaping wound in my soul. In fact, when I'm feeling down and angry at Jacob for not meeting one of my needs I have to stop and ask myself if there is a lack in my relationship with the Lord first. Am I expecting this person to make me feel whole when no human relationship was intended to do that?

No line, no change in color, so I set it on the counter and started to brush my teeth. Didn't want to be late for work. I happened to glance back down at it before throwing it in the trash and I saw the beginning of a pink streak.</p>\n<p>OH MY GOSH. (those weren't the exact words that came out...)</p>\n<p>If my years working at a pregnancy center taught me anything it was that any pink line meant something was going on. This was real.</p>\n<p>I always had the vision I would find out I was pregnant, keep it from my husband until I could come up with some cute little baby surprise and wow him. Well, none of that happens in real life.</p>\n<p>I instantly woke him up, tried to get words out through my hyper breathing, and told him what the test said. He replied with a slobbery lisp through his nighttime mouth guard, \"Are you serious?\".</p>\n<p>Pure romance.</p>\n<p>I was told about three years ago from a doctor, \"Once you get pregnant, your anxiety will significantly improve. You will probably not need any medication and in fact, your hormone levels might stabilize and you'll never need medication again.\" That is not a direct quote but rather the gist of the conversation. I was skeptical of this projection; but really hoping and praying those words were true.</p>\n<p>For me, they weren't.</p>\n<p>In fact, my anxiety became unmanageable after my doctor told me to quickly ween of all medication and just suck it up. Maybe the pregnancy would give me more 'motivation'. Needless to say I was terrified, angry, and desperate for relief and peace.</p>\n<p>All I could think about was how in the world was I suppose to be a mother when I could barely find the motivation to get through the day, let alone smile.</p>\n<p>Since then I have sought the opinion of three other doctors (one of them being a highly-qualified specialist in maternal infant health psychiatry). I am back on a steady dose of medication, saw my therapist for a couple months, and feeling overall huge improvements.</p>\n<p>I lost myself for a month. I was unable to enjoy and fully celebrate the fact I was creating life inside me because the worry, anxiety, and depression completely took over. If you are ever in a similar situation; seek multiple opinions. Ultimately you will know what's best. Most often the best decision is the one where you feel whole and complete. That's what my child needs; a mother who can be present, whole, complete, and peaceful.</p>\n<p>Since finding out we were going to have a baby, life has gotten crazy. We realized we needed to move... a tiny 400 square-foot apartment with a baby and a black lab just wasn't how I wanted to spend my time. Thus began the searching and moving process.</p>\n<p>Almost four months into my pregnancy I was driving home from work and was hit by a man trying to cross five lanes of traffic, right into the drivers side. That resulted in a multitude of medical tests and tears, all of which came back fine. We are praising the Lord for that!</p>\n<p>Then my husband found out some not-so-encouraging medical news, which has completely upped my stress level.</p>\n<p>Then our doggie hurt his paw and had to go to the emergency vet and wear the cone of shame for a whole week. He was even on dog narcotics! It was sad but almost comical to watch.</p>\n<p>Then we bought our new car and it's already in the shop. We've owned it for four days.</p>\n<p>I forgot to mention in the midst of all this I started a new job and Jacob is having trouble at his work. When my husband, who is always the calm one, is constantly stressed it really throws us for a loop.</p>\n<p>My beloved grandmother is going through a possible cancer-scare, which has our whole family in tense waiting.</p>\n<p>We are moving to a completely new city in a month and a half.</p>\n<p>Needless to say I am so thankful for the medication I am able to take to help me cope with life lately. I am even more thankful for the Lord's constant provision and peace. <a href=\"https://bible.org/seriespage/60-compound-names-jehovah-jireh-rapha-nissi\">Jehovah-jireh</a>, the Lord provides. My favorite saying and my favorite truth to live day by day.</p>\n<p>\"The Revelation of the Name <strong>Jehovah-Jireh</strong>, Genesis 22:12-14. The meaning of this name is The Lord Who Provides. The name is literally, The Lord Who Sees, or The Lord Who Will See To It. This is what we long for when we have a need that is personal and special; One who will see to our needs and provide for us. This is what Jehovah-Jireh means; the Lord Who will see to it that my every need is met. One Who knows my need because He sees.\"</p>\n<p>Regular life stress can be really difficult for someone dealing with an anxiety disorder. What some can brush of and 'not worry about' can consume others. We have to be patient with those around us who we don't fully understand. I can't even express how much patience and compassion are necessary to help me through any struggle.</p>\n<p>On a positive note, we are just days away from finding out the gender! Will we need a pink or blue nursery??</p>"

There we stole our first moment alone as husband and wife. I remember feeling so thankful, so relieved, and so emotional I just wept into his embrace. It was a moment of pure joy.</p>\n<p>I get asked at work by students once in a while if I'm married. Always by some rowdy teenage boy (surprise).</p>\n<p>I say yes I am, and routinely point to my wedding ring. Funny how no one notices! Maybe it's a guy thing. Maybe I need a flashing one or something.</p>\n<p>Last week this happened again. After explaining the reason for the engagement ring and the wedding band- how they're different and which one you give first- one of the boys asked me if I loved my husband.</p>\n<p>I said yes, I do love him.</p>\n<p>No, do you really love him?</p>\n<p>I said yes, he's a great guy.</p>\n<p>Then he said do you really think you'll be together forever? Like honestly?</p>\n<p>First of all, I find it intriguing he wanted to know. I don't know his family history or if he comes from a broken home but I know he told me he never wants to get married.</p>\n<p>To answer his question, I paused. No one has ever asked me that before.</p>\n<p>I replied with a yes, I do believe that.</p>\n<p>He questioned my responsewith a squinting of his eyes and the cocking of his head.</p>\n<p>The divorce rate is astronomical. Who gets married and truly commits to be together 'til death due you part anymore? It's more like \"I commit to you until you stop fulfilling my needs or I simply change my mind.\" (I do understand the legitimate need for divorce, especially Biblical reasons such as adultery, etc) However; I hear of MANY couples splitting up over reasons that aren't found in the Bible. Christian and non-Christian couples alike. Life happens, I get it. We make mistakes and we make choices.</p>\n<p>I've been thinking about this conversation all week. Do I really believe we will be together forever? I'm terrified to commit to anything <strong>FOREVER.</strong></p>\n<p>What a scary word!</p>\n<p>What if he hurts my feelings? What if we lose the love and passion? What if I'm no longer physically attracted to him?</p>\n<p>The answer is I committed myself in front of God and my family. I stood up on a stage in front of my younger siblings, who I would do anything for, as they heard me make a promise. Probably the most serious promise I will ever make in my lifetime; to love and honor this man despite the ebbs and flows of life.</p>\n<p>We are \"young\", we are \"in love\", but we are also <strong>committed, loyal,</strong> and <strong>trusting</strong> in the Lord and his design for our marriage.</p>\n<p>I hesitate to share these thoughts with all of you because I know marriage and divorce are sensitive subjects for some. I sympathize with all the pain the loss of a marriage uncovers. I have seen it in my family and with my closest friends. Mourning the end of a marriage is like mourning the death of a loved one. Something living, breathing, and sacred dies and the loss is felt in a heavy way. The good news is God brings beauty into all darkness.</p>\n<p>If I could go back in time and compose a more thoughtful answer to this young man, I would say some of those things.</p>\n<p>I want him to know that marriage can be beautiful. In fact, it was designed to be <strong>beautiful.</strong> I want him to know how the Lord's love is a great model for love in a marriage. How in forgiveness there is freedom.</p>\n<p>I wish I could always be prepared with a thoughtful, inspiring, God-filled answer; alas, I am human. Maybe next time.</p>"}}},{id:"c3KvUsScBXiua26eqWu4ASO",title:"Stress & Gender: There's a Real Difference",category:[{id:"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW",category:"Anxiety"},{id:"G69JOFlSIogQYAiS0mW0G",category:"Emotions"},{id:"c2zAmsqajH2gqq2yiaIsGYK",category:"Women's Issues"},{id:"c2nxt6vSx8Yuw6aK8EGYQ66",category:"Marriage"}],createdAt:"February 18, 2018",featuredImage:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,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",aspectRatio:1,src:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/57p7DvW9PqM0oeC2uy8ME6/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/StressandGender.png?w=800&q=50",srcSet:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/57p7DvW9PqM0oeC2uy8ME6/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/StressandGender.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/57p7DvW9PqM0oeC2uy8ME6/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/StressandGender.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/57p7DvW9PqM0oeC2uy8ME6/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/StressandGender.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w",srcWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/57p7DvW9PqM0oeC2uy8ME6/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/StressandGender.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp",srcSetWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/57p7DvW9PqM0oeC2uy8ME6/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/StressandGender.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/57p7DvW9PqM0oeC2uy8ME6/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/StressandGender.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/57p7DvW9PqM0oeC2uy8ME6/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/StressandGender.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w",sizes:"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"},id:"c57p7DvW9PqM0oeC2uy8ME6",file:{url:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/57p7DvW9PqM0oeC2uy8ME6/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/StressandGender.png",fileName:"StressandGender.png",contentType:"image/png"}},content:{childMarkdownRemark:{html:"<p>Sometimes I wish I were a man. Not in a \"I'm confused about who I am\" sorta way. It just seems simpler. No monthly gift where your uterus tortures you for not being pregnant, no shaving your legs, no messing with your crazy bed-head for twenty minutes before work, no make up, blah blah blah. In my experience, men also have less anxiety overall and an easier time dealing with stress. Disclaimer: I realize this is a very over generalized statement, and some men do struggle with intense anxiety. Just not too many of the men I know.</p>\n<p>With the exception of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), women have twice the risk for most anxiety disorders as men.</p>\n<p>That's science. You can't argue with science. As a woman, I am at twice the risk for an anxiety disorder as any man. Lucky me! I won the anxiety disorder lottery. I sometimes ask my husband how he deals with stress. His usual response is, \"I just don't think about it. Then it goes away,\". Oh how I wonder what that would be like! It almost makes me angry with him. What do you mean you just don't think about it? Don't you worry about all the hundreds of things I worry about every day? How can you just fall fast asleep when you know there's three loads of laundry just waiting in the hamper and no groceries in the fridge?</p>\n<p>I have learned from him. It's like we were made for each other. We balance each other well- I thank the Lord every day for that.</p>\n<p>I am a woman, and I am learning to embrace everything that comes with that title. Emotions, hormones, anxiety, femininity. It's all beautiful.</p>\n<p>When my husband and I were dating we read two books called \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Women-Only-Revised-Updated-Edition/dp/1601424442/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_y\">For Women Only</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601424450/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=1944687682&#x26;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&#x26;pf_rd_t=201&#x26;pf_rd_i=1590523172&#x26;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&#x26;pf_rd_r=1STM30EC0D16PD0EDEW5\">For Men Only</a>\" by Shaunti Feldhahn and her husband Jeff Feldhahn. THESE BOOKS ARE AMAZING. We cannot stress that enough. It provides insight into the opposite gender's head you didn't even know existed. There are sections on love, intimacy, communication, and even stress. The area that talked about stress and worry was one of my favorites. I'm always looking for clear and concise ways to express to my husband how my mind works, and when I can find a professional clearly explain my thinking process, that's so incredibly helpful.</p>\n<p>Shaunti and Jeff describe women's minds by using the illustration of computer windows. Women have tons and tons of windows open. Each window represents a thought, worry, concern, etc. \"Women's thought lives are like busy computers with multiple windows open and all running at once,\".</p>\n<p>When a women in the book was asked, how do you operate with all those thoughts going on in your head at once? Why don't you just concentrate on one thing and turn all the other windows off?</p>\n<p>Her response, \"Because I can't. And even if I did, they'd come back,\".</p>\n<p>Can you ladies relate to that? I sure can. In a man's mind, they don't understand why we can't just close the windows. It's as simple as that, duh. Sorry guys... us women weren't wired that way. Women are shown to be unable to close their windows and \"<a href=\"http://abovethebattle.com/just-try-not-to-think-about-it/\">just not think about it</a>\"the way men can.</p>\n<p>In fact, in the \"For Women Only Book\", there isn't even a sectiondevoted to windows or worry thoughts. It doesn't exists because there are more important areas of a man's mind they focus on.</p>\n<p>I always tell my husband I don't expect him to understand everything about me, especially when it relates to anxiety. It does feel good when I come across someone, a blog, a book, that does seem to 'get it'. What I need from him is compassion. That's what I urge you to give to yourself and give to others you don't understand-regardless of their struggles.</p>\n<p>Spread the compassion!</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/anxiety-disorders#ixzz3eYoCCwnR\">Anxiety disorders</a> | <a href=\"http://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/anxiety-disorders#ixzz3eYoCCwnR\">University of Maryland Medical Center</a></p>"}}}]}},pathContext:{category:"Marriage"}}}});
