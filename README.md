Above the battle is a blog that is built with [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)

This is a mental health and wellness blog for women my wife created years ago. It's intention was a place for women to hear stories about real life struggles with anxiety and motherhood. It was at one time very popular, however my wife hasn't written a post in a couple years now.
