due date was Monday, November fourteenth. I woke up and went to work just like any other day- except this day I was hoping to not return home. I had hopes for a natural birth. The doctors told me I was young and healthy, this was going to be great. I kept telling my coworkers I thought my water was going to break; a woman just knows when somethings not 'normal' down there. Late into the night I got into bed and felt a warm gush... just like the doctor said I would. Then we were off! I was so incredibly excited yet calm. We texted, called, and emailed family and coworkers. Life was about to change and I just had no idea what to expect.</p>\\n<p>We parked in the parking garage and I felt a sense of pride that I could still walk around, although I was definitely leaving a mess behind. My husband made me ride in a wheelchair, which was probably the best idea. He's good at being kind to me.</p>\\n<p>The hospital was eerily quiet, but it was two in the morning. No contractions started so the doctors had me pacing the hallways in my fancy hospital socks. One hour, two hours, nothing. And then came my first unexpected blow: we need to induce you. Sorry, you're not progressing.</p>\\n<p>Five hours later and still less than halfway dilated. My heart dropped to the floor when the doctor (the first of three) told me this was going to be an evening baby and the sun had barely just risen. I had no energy left at this point. Then came unexpected blow number two: I asked for the epidural.</p>\\n<p>Time passed in a haze as I lay in the hospital bed, contracting but barely feeling anything but a heaviness, listening to a repeating soundtrack my husband put on as a distraction. People kept bringing him food; I was beyond envious he didn't have to live through the day like I did.</p>\\n<p>Late into the evening there was a doctor, a nurse, two nurse interns, and my husband all in the room when my doctor said the biggest unexpected blow number three: you might want to consider a c-section at this point. Baby is not dropping and you seem to not be dilated beyond eight centimeters. That's when the tears came. And the vomit. Did I mention all the vomit? They said it was the medication, lack of food, hormones... either way it sucked. I was so desperate for relief and afraid the baby would never come so I said yes. And I don't regret my decision, I just feel sad for the way I experienced it.</p>\\n<p>I remember telling Jacob in the hospital that I was never having another baby. We were adopting. That is that. Everyone said I would change my mind... but I think i'm still working through the trauma of it all. We want Eli to have a sibling: to learn how to share and live in community. I just don't know if I can handle that experience again. When you battle anxiety and depression, mixed with wacky hormones, throw in an unexpected emergency surgery, oh and a real life baby: you get fear. I have lived with fear since the moment he was born. Please don't misunderstand, I have joy. I love that child more than I love myself. But there is a degree of fear underlying my thoughts I can't quite put my finger on.</p>\\n<p>Today and every day I try to live in the present. I try to hold him and rock him to sleep and not to rush this time of life together. I pray, I ask for guidance, call the doctor all the time, and try not to take myself too seriously.</p>\\n<p>We sure did get lucky with a baby who still smiles at me even though he can't breathe out of his nose right now. My grandma told me he was going to bring a lot of joy into our lives and she was correct. Despite my fear, despite my uncertainty, he is teaching me to just sit there and giggle with him.</p>\\n<p>Welcome to this crazy world Eli William!</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c5I1fMVhdew0GemeMWoEKS6\",\"title\":\"In the Mirror\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"G69JOFlSIogQYAiS0mW0G\",\"category\":\"Emotions\"},{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"},{\"id\":\"c2zAmsqajH2gqq2yiaIsGYK\",\"category\":\"Women's Issues\"}],\"slug\":\"in-the-mirror\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.5007235890014472,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=400&h=267&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=800&h=533&q=50 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=1200&h=800&q=50 1200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=1600&h=1066&q=50 1600w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=2074&h=1382&q=50 2074w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=200&h=133&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=400&h=267&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=800&h=533&q=50&fm=webp 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=1200&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 1200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=1600&h=1066&q=50&fm=webp 1600w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=2074&h=1382&q=50&fm=webp 2074w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Every night when I am awoken by little hunger cries I roll out of bed, grab my sweater and head down the nightlight-lit hall to the nursery. I look down at the little boy wincing in his bassinet, pick him up, and gently kiss him on his forehead. In complete silence, with exception of his white noise machine, I change his diaper, re-swaddle, head to the rocking chair, and begin to nurse him back to comfort. We sit by the glow of Christmas lights. Just the two of us.</p>\\n<p>We're still getting to know each other.</p>\\n<p>He recognizes the sound of my voice and the smell of my skin. He just started turning his head towards me when I speak.</p>\\n<p>I am learning the meaning of his different cries. The hunger cries, the painful cries, the cries of boredom, and the desire for comfort.</p>\\n<p>When we first brought him home I didn't know if I could do it. I couldn't soothe him every time he fussed. I wasn't sure if he was hungry, uncomfortable, scared. My body hurt from the c-section and the drop in hormone levels left me with a floodgate of tears and nervousness.My husband and Iheard phantom cries every time we went into a different room and sometimes took turns outside with the dog just to get a break from the crying.</p>\\n<p>During our first week together in the middle of the night I was rocking my son for what seemed like hours. He wasn't crying but wasn't sleeping either. I was so tired; my lower back was aching from holding him in the same position, afraid that if I moved him he would never fall asleep. Then I caught a glimpse of our silhouette in the bedroom mirror. I could see the outline of my messy hair and bad posture. In my arms I was holding a baby. My baby. My child.</p>\\n<p>This is me, this is my identity now. Mother. It's my duty and purpose to be awake in the early hours of the morning rocking our son;could this be real? My reflection confirms my thoughts.</p>\\n<p>Every night I pass the mirror and see myself with a baby in my arms. Sometimes I just stop and stare... is that really me? Is this really us? It's like I want to seal the memory in my mind. It's a sacred moment, my son and me together in the dark.</p>\\n<p>Every day we learn a little more and life gets a little easier. Nothing is perfect but everything we are experiencing is perfectly human. I am thankful.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c6dfXLxkndK8g4osEywauG0\",\"title\":\"My Marriage: What I've Learned & What I Need to

honor of my husband's birthday this month I want to reflect a bit on our marriage,our sweet love story, and what I've learned through relationship.</p>\\n<p>I write this in almost every wedding card we give: <strong>Marriage is my favorite part of life right now.</strong> It's so amazing to live with your best friend, wake up to him every morning, cook with him or for him, hold hands, and live life knowing you have someone who fully supports and loves you. Some say, \\\"you're still in the honeymoon phase, just wait ten years\\\". We've heard that one before. Or, \\\"oh, it won't last\\\". Let me preface this post with some disclaimers and insights into my life.</p>\\n<p>First, I am not a marriage expert and would never claim to be. I am just blessed to be in a great marriage that honors the Lord and has a strong foundation. Secondly, while we've only been married less than three years, Jacob and I have been together almost six years and friends for nine years. I do believe the time spent together and growing together has given me tremendous knowledge about relationship. Lastly, our relationship is not without conflict. We spent the first two years of dating fighting almost on a weekly basis. Tears, angry phone calls, lack of trust, you name it. Long distance isn't the easiest. Conflict is included in my definition of a healthy relationship. In fact, the other day we gave each other the silent treatment for over an hour... it happens. It's only how you grow through the conflict that matters. I realize now I am writing this post as much for myself as for others. I need these remindersto look back on when life gets tough; when my anxiety levels rise and I need direction.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say, I do not believe the naysayers who claim love doesn't last, the honeymoon phase can't possibly last. I know too many people who are in strong committed relationships after ten, twenty, thirty years. In fact, I'm completely excited to grow old together. I want to be with him when our kids graduate high school, when we retire from work. I want to take care of him if he ever gets sick; live up to my vows through sickness and in health. It is my hope that through our relationship we can grow as individuals and be an example of the Lord's love on earth.</p>\\n<p>Since the moment I met Jacob when I was 15 (he was a cool college kid by then), I felt something special. We had an instant connection. He was attracted to my, let's say, beauty. And I just thought he was a goofy kid I loved to be around. It didn't take long for us to develop feelings for each other but life got in the way: other relationships, school, my fear of boys, and even family. I always knew somehow we'd end up together- soul mates? Who knows.</p>\\n<p>My friends would see us interact at college and constantly told me he was in love with me. I brushed it off. My grandmother sensed his affection for me and knew it was strong, I wasn't ready to hear it. I avoided Jacob when he started writing me letters and wanting to spend more time together. It was too real, too fast. Then he had a dream.</p>\\n<p>I really do believe God can speak through our dreams and this is a great example. He had a dream about me, and he took that as a sign it might be time to pursue more than a friendship. And for the first time in years I didn't completely resist him.</p>\\n<p>I credit Jacob for the traditional-ness of our relationship. I can't think of any other way to say it but he always tries to do the right thing. He asked my dad if he could date me, he waited patiently until I was ready, he didn't kiss me for almost three months after we started dating,and asked me if he could kiss me one night under the stars. He stressed respect, physical boundaries, communication, and honesty. I'm not sure how he got so wise but I have learned more from him about relationships than any book, sermon, tv show, or friend. To my wonderful mother and father in law, if you're reading this, you did something right!</p>\\n<p><strong>Six things I've learned from marriage:</strong></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>It is a reflection of the Lord's love and grace for us. It is through my marriage I've come to a deeper understanding of grace and forgiveness. Through marriage we can show the world God's design for family and relationship. It is through marriage we practice the love of the Lord on earth and show others that by His strength we can endure hardships. I've needed a lot of grace from Jacob over the years. I have struggles and he has struggles. By requiring so much grace and love from him I believe I've learned better how to give it and also receive it from the Lord.</li>\\n<li>My husband is loved by God. He is a child of God. I once heard a preacher say when you get married, God also becomes your father-in-law. Your spouse first belonged to the Lord and they are still cherished by their heavenly father. That really puts it into perspective for me. I love and value my spouse but God loves and values them more than I could ever understand. This principle is true for everyone in our lives, not just our spouses.</li>\\n<li>Love is a decision. I'm sure you've heard that before... but do you know its depth? Love is a commitment and a commitment I have to learn to choose even on the hard days. I have to choose to respond in love when all I want to do is scream and yell at Jacob and tell him how many ways he messed up. I have to choose to respond in love when he confesses something to me that hurts my feelings. I have to stick on love's side when he tells me how I've hurt him or ways I could grow as a person. Sometimes I don't respond in love right away. Sometimes I have to come back an hour or a day later and apologize for what I said or didn't say. That's the beauty of grace and forgiveness. We are both imperfect in our imperfect-ness. Commitmentis the only way love works.</li>\\n<li>Marriage is stinkin' hard but it's so unbelievably worth it. Life is not meant to be lived alone. We were created for our partner and our partner was created for us. If you're not married or don't plan on getting married, then switch the word 'marriage' with 'relationship'. Relationships can be so difficult but we were created for community!</li>\\n</ol>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The person who tries to live alone will not succeed as a human being. His heart withers if it does not answer another heart. His mind shrinks away if he hears only the echoes of his own thoughts and finds no other inspiration. -Pearl S. Buck</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<ol start=\\\"5\\\">\\n<li>We are both our own person. We were Jacob and Ashley, two distinctly unique human beings before we were married, and we are those same people today. Jacob has his own desires, wants, talents, and so do I. I do not own him. I cannot change him. He cannot make me fit any mold. We are who we are individually and together; and together we create something really special when we allow each other to be our own.</li>\\n<li>No other human being will ever fill the hole in my heart. C.S. Lewis referred to it as a 'God shaped hole'. It's so unfair for me to expect my husband to meet all my needs and fill every gaping wound in my soul. In fact, when I'm feeling down and angry at Jacob for not meeting one of my needs I have to stop and ask myself if there is a lack in my relationship with the Lord first. Am I expecting this person to make me feel whole when no human relationship was intended to do that? My grandmother always told me those close to you are your easiest targets for taking out any negative feelings. Boy was she right.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Here's to you Jacob; I'm thankful for your 28 years of life and for choosing me to share the journey with you. Thank you for being committed to our marriage and for giving me security and love like I've never known.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"tOQlNA9lyoskcoUgqMEqm\",\"title\":\"Between Life & Death\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c5ORZhJRBfiwcyiOEMACoGK\",\"category\":\"Depression\"},{\"id\":\"G69JOFlSIogQYAiS0mW0G\",\"category\":\"Emotions\"},{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"}],\"slug\":\"between-life-death\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png\",\"fileName\":\"052819-1.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>I'm sitting here on my balcony looking at the last little triangle of sunlight shining on a tree as it sets behind us.

Grandma is dying.</p>\\n<p>It's hard to live life when there's so much good and so much bad.</p>\\n<p>Living between anticipated new life and anticipated death is a weird space. And both are completely new to me. That's scary. I have no idea what it's like to give birth or to be a mother; and I have no idea what it's like to lose someone I truly love with all my soul.

Needless to say I was terrified, angry, and desperate for relief and peace.</p>\\n<p>All I could think about was how in the world was I suppose to be a mother when I could barely find the motivation to get through the day, let alone smile.</p>\\n<p>Since then I have sought the opinion of three other doctors (one of them being a highly-qualified specialist in maternal infant health psychiatry). I am back on a steady dose of medication, saw my therapist for a couple months, and feeling overall huge improvements.</p>\\n<p>I lost myself for a month. I was unable to enjoy and fully celebrate the fact I was creating life inside me because the worry, anxiety, and depression completely took over. If you are ever in a similar situation; seek multiple opinions. Ultimately you will know what's best. Most often the best decision is the one where you feel whole and complete. That's what my child needs; a mother who can be present, whole, complete, and peaceful.</p>\\n<p>Since finding out we were going to have a baby, life has gotten crazy. We realized we needed to move... a tiny 400 square-foot apartment with a baby and a black lab just wasn't how I wanted to spend my time. Thus began the searching and moving process.</p>\\n<p>Almost four months into my pregnancy I was driving home from work and was hit by a man trying to cross five lanes of traffic, right into the drivers side. That resulted in a multitude of medical tests and tears, all of which came back fine. We are praising the Lord for that!</p>\\n<p>Then my husband found out some not-so-encouraging medical news, which has completely upped my stress level.</p>\\n<p>Then our doggie hurt his paw and had to go to the emergency vet and wear the cone of shame for a whole week. He was even on dog narcotics! It was sad but almost comical to watch.</p>\\n<p>Then we bought our new car and it's already in the shop. We've owned it for four days.</p>\\n<p>I forgot to mention in the midst of all this I started a new job and Jacob is having trouble at his work. When my husband, who is always the calm one, is constantly stressed it really throws us for a loop.</p>\\n<p>My beloved grandmother is going through a possible cancer-scare, which has our whole family in tense waiting.</p>\\n<p>We are moving to a completely new city in a month and a half.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say I am so thankful for the medication I am able to take to help me cope with life lately. I am even more thankful for the Lord's constant provision and peace. <a href=\\\"https://bible.org/seriespage/60-compound-names-jehovah-jireh-rapha-nissi\\\">Jehovah-jireh</a>, the Lord provides. My favorite saying and my favorite truth to live day by day.</p>\\n<p>\\\"The Revelation of the Name <strong>Jehovah-Jireh</strong>, Genesis 22:12-14. The meaning of this name is The Lord Who Provides. The name is literally, The Lord Who Sees, or The Lord Who Will See To It. This is what we long for when we have a need that is personal and special; One who will see to our needs and provide for us. This is what Jehovah-Jireh means; the Lord Who will see to it that my every need is met. One Who knows my need because He sees.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Regular life stress can be really difficult for someone dealing with an anxiety disorder. What some can brush of and 'not worry about' can consume others. We have to be patient with those around us who we don't fully understand. I can't even express how much patience and compassion are necessary to help me through any struggle.</p>\\n<p>On a positive note, we are just days away from finding out the gender! Will we need a pink or blue nursery??</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"GJIfENJHCUkEk28SW6s4w\",\"title\":\"My Recent Lessons From God\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"},{\"id\":\"c2zAmsqajH2gqq2yiaIsGYK\",\"category\":\"Women's Issues\"}],\"slug\":\"my-recent-lessons-from-god\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.5105740181268883,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=200&h=132&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=400&h=265&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&h=530&q=50 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=1000&h=662&q=50 1000w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=200&h=132&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=400&h=265&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&h=530&q=50&fm=webp 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=1000&h=662&q=50&fm=webp 1000w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"blogpost1.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>I've gotten into a spiritual rut lately (I'm talking months and months here)- constantly praying to know God more, to feel his presence, to trust him more, to see his beauty around me. It't not always easy to find the motivation or sense of urgency to study his Word and truly submit myself in prayer. Most days I don't 'feel' like it and honestly, I've had the thought \\\"if the Lord wants me to know him better, he will reveal himself to me.\\\"</p>\\n<p>I recently went to my first women's retreat with church. I was hoping to learn something new and exciting but instead I was reminded of something I already knew but has completely pushed out of my mind: Those who seek the Lord find him when they seek him with all their hearts (Jeremiah 29:13). You mean I actually have to put effort into this?</p>\\n<p>Yes, yes I do. You do, too.</p>\\n<p>\\\"God provides everything we need, we have to avail ourselves to the things he provided.\\\" -April Barrett</p>\\n<p>I want to encourage you if you have a faith life but need to grow spiritually- it's time to take action. This morning I had some free time before my day started. To read Harry Potter or not to read Harry Potter... then I saw my devotional book sitting on the shelf. I didn't really feel like reading something serious but I paused and had a thought: my emotions and feelings can be deceiving. Just because I don't feel like something doesn't mean it's not right. I picked up the devotional and I so clearly heard from the Lord. The title was <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Utmost-His-Highest-Oswald-Chambers/dp/1572937378/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&#x26;dpID=41fpis7rWdL&#x26;dpSrc=sims&#x26;preST=_AC_UL320_SR214%2C320_&#x26;refRID=0FJ9A79WTX8Y862NFK3P\\\">\\\"Insight Not Emotion\\\".</a></p>\\n<p>\\\"If we try to reintroduce the rare moments of inspirations, it is a sign that it is not God we want. We are making a fetish of the moments when God did come and speak, and insisting that He must do it again; whereas what God wants us to do is to walk by faith...We must never make our moments of inspiration our standard; our standard is our duty.\\\"</p>\\n<p>The standard of my moments with the Lord and the knowledge of his presence in my life is my duty. Wow. <strong>In order to achieve oneness with him I have to make an effort, an actual effort.</strong> Moments of inspiration from the Lord are such a gift. This devotional says God will give us touches of his inspiration when we are not in danger of being led away by them. I really look forward to those moments when I can distinctly hear the voice of the Lord. They reassure my faith but they do not sustain it.</p>\\n<p>I love my husband every day not just the moments when he sweeps me off my feet and takes my breath away. Those occasions are special and rare; and that's the way I want it.</p>\\n<p>It's so hard to make time for something when we lack inspiration. I personally struggle with that. However, I still brush my teeth every day and do the dishes (not quite every day...). I just do it because it's the right thing to do. I brush my teeth because I want to care for my body and prevent future issues. I wash dishes because I like a clean home and don't want to smell the rot of old food.</p>\\n<p>Similarly, we can view our spiritual lives that way. We need to get rid of the rot and the stink that sometimes fills up our lives and a great way to do that is by seeking the Lord. But really, truly, seeking him.</p>\\n<p>I'm still working on this. Life can be so absolutely crazy I am thankful for the constant presence of God even when I lack motivation to seek him. That's how much he love us!</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c50J6syQf1YS4I2WkQI4YaO\",\"title\":\"If You're Going Through Hell\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c5ORZhJRBfiwcyiOEMACoGK\",\"category\":\"Depression\"},{\"id\":\"G69JOFlSIogQYAiS0mW0G\",\"category\":\"Emotions\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"}],\"slug\":\"if-youre-going-through-hell\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.4989293361884368,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=400&h=267&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=700&h=467&q=50 700w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=200&h=133&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=400&h=267&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=700&h=467&q=50&fm=webp 700w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Ever have those days, weeks, maybe even months when you are just in a funk?

am having trouble coming to terms with my radical, conservative, equal rights, homophobic, socialist, universalist, Christian, anti-gun, pro-life, Republican, left-winged, peace-loving, Jesus following, gay-marriage supporting, heterosexual, Bible thumping self.</p>\\n<p>So many thoughts, so many gray areas, so I wait.</p>\\n<p>I wait for guidance from the Father.</p>\\n<p>I wait to act on my beliefs and convictions until I hear and feel the clear voice of Someone omnipotent.</p>\\n<p>Some answers I have received. Some answers seem to change as I mature and expand my horizons. Some answers have not wavered although outside pressures direct me elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>There are red-lettered answers in my Bible. As I read them I can picture Jesus standing in a crowd, teaching his followers with his dirty sandals and unkempt hair. He doesn't notice his appearance because he is more focused on the beggar at the street corner.</p>\\n<p>I desperately want to be like that. I want to look past people's sexual orientations, political persuasions, past-lives, and addictions. I want to see their soul and meet them where they are like Jesus did.</p>\\n<p>I was first introduced to Christianity at a Baptist church. Women were expected to wear skirts and not to say \\\"darn\\\" (too close to the real thing). That's all I knew; and I was taught the most important thing in life is everyone say the ABC prayer before they die.</p>\\n<p>Accept Jesus. Believe he died for you. Confess your sins. BAM. Saved.</p>\\n<p>I developed a fearful and judgmental attitude towards anyone whowas a \\\"non-Christian\\\".</p>\\n<p>I am thankful for that experience because it's where I first stood in the presence of the Lord and that has changed my life. I am thankful to have an understanding of how many conservative Christians think. And I am also thankful to have grown out of that mindset, realizing knowing the Lord is an issue of the heart not a matter of aformula.</p>\\n<p>But now, here I sit, a twenty-something Christian living in modern day America. My heart and mind are torn between tradition, family beliefs, political ideologies, and religion.</p>\\n<p>I love the Lord.</p>\\n<p>I love people.</p>\\n<p>I don't have the same attitude and feelings as some of my family members. And that's okay.</p>\\n<p>I have to admit, one of my guilty pleasures is starting debates with those who have very strong political persuasions. My goal is to convince my father I'm voting for Hilary Clinton. He might not be able to sleep at night, but it's too funny to resist.</p>\\n<p>I'm left with questions: who would Jesus vote for? What would modern-day American Jesus do with his free time? How would he minister?</p>\\n<p>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</p>\\n<p>James 1:27</p>\\n<p>I'm a seeker of the Lord who will keep on seekin'.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c3wzTVOZhfWSweeIIgAWMoW\",\"title\":\"Save Your Venom\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c5ORZhJRBfiwcyiOEMACoGK\",\"category\":\"Depression\"},{\"id\":\"G69JOFlSIogQYAiS0mW0G\",\"category\":\"Emotions\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"},{\"id\":\"c2zAmsqajH2gqq2yiaIsGYK\",\"category\":\"Women's Issues\"}],\"slug\":\"save-your-venom\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"happy-new-year.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Since I got an iPhone last year, I've been pretty obsessed with podcasts. My current favorites are Serial and Heather Dubrow's World. I listen to them every week while I walk the dog, drive in the car, or go to the gym. Earlier this week I was listening once again as I happily worked out on the spin bike (okay fine, I was sweating profusely and constantly staring at the 30 minute timer willing it to end). Anyways, I heard a podcast with and the featured guest was <a href=\\\"http://kristiling.com/\\\">Kristi Ling</a>, the happiness strategist. I really don't like the word 'happy' because it's such a fluffy word. It just sounds so shallow to me.</p>\\n<p>Everyone wants to be happy, find their happiness, find someone to make them happy.</p>\\n<p>When I heard this lady who is an expert on happiness was coming on to the show I wasn't expecting much...honestly. However, she had great points and great ideas- I was so inspired I decided to write about it. I actually, perhaps, maybe, will consider buying her newest book.</p>\\n<p>Kristi Ling wears a rattlesnake ring every day. Kind of a weird piece of jewelry if you ask me. For her, it's a daily reminder to 'save her venom'.</p>\\n<p>Rattlesnakes have very poisonous venom. They need it to kill their prey so they can eat and survive. If approached by a threat, the snake will not strike. They wait until they are absolutely sure their very life is being threatened. Why? They need to save their venom! If they don't preserve their supply, they won't have it when they really need it. It's a waste.</p>\\n<p>I LOVE THIS ANALOGY.</p>\\n<p>I need to save my venom! It so perfectly relates to those struggling with anxiety. We get so anxious and freaked out by what-ifs all the time. Our fight or flight responses kick in and we go into hyper drive. For me, it doesn't matter if there is a real dangerous threat, my venom is ready to strike at any hint of fear.</p>\\n<p>The other day I was driving in the car and started to become consumed with worry that my car would break down and I would have no way to get to work. I started thinking about how we would pay for repairs, could we afford a new car, would Jacob be able to drive me to work in the morning?</p>\\n<p>Then I paused and remembered the rattlesnake. I want to be a rattlesnake. I want to save my venom.

Many are throwing ideas out there like all Muslim's should be deported until further questioning or Muslim immigration should not be allowed. People are making jokes about needing to build a fence to keep the Arabs out and not the Mexicans. Some are spreading anger and wanting to act with un-just violence.</p>\\n<p>Terrorism is real but to say that all Muslims need to be under scrutiny or leave the countryis like saying all adolescent white males who like video games are potentially mass-shooters and we should probably deport them until further notice.</p>\\n<p>If you haven't heard, there have been over 52 school shootings this year. The majority by white, middle-upper class males.</p>\\n<p>That is tragedy. Terrorism is tragedy. This world is full of tragedy. How can we combat this? I don't know. I do know it's not by actingfrom a place of fear or ignorance.</p>\\n<p>Every year in American history there have been racial tensions. Every decade there's a new group that's ostracized and stereotyped.</p>\\n<p>Native Americans were originally considered savages.</p>\\n<p>In 1902 Chinese immigration was made permanently illegal.</p>\\n<p>When Irish immigrants first came to the United States they were ridiculed and forced into slums.</p>\\n<p>In the 1920's Germans were seen as an evil threat, people were afraid they had radical political beliefs and would be the downfall of American society as we knew it. Some were deported, arrested, and probably tortured.</p>\\n<p>Jim Crow laws were practiced from the 1880's until 1965, and African Americans were seen as lesser for centuries. Some people still think this way.</p>\\n<p>Today we are fearful of illegal immigrants who are \\\"stealing our jobs and corrupting our county\\\" because they want a better life for their precious children and can't afford the legal application process. (I met a Guatemalan woman who has applied for a visa for her elderly mother at least three times, each time it was denied. She might not be able to afford to pay to apply again.)</p>\\n<p>Now we want to deport Muslims because we have fear they are weakening our great nation: just like the Native Americans, the Chinese, the Germans, the Blacks.</p>\\n<p>I work with Muslims. I buy groceries from them. I wave to them on the street while we are walking our dogs together. I take Zumba class with Muslim women; we talk about how much we would rather be eating french fries. I see them without their scarves on and feel like I know them in a secret way. They are real people with real lives.</p>\\n<p>I am aware I am not a military strategist. I don't understand all politics and I don't mean to say all people feel this way. I know some who do, and I can assure you know someone like this too. Someone who is acting from fear and not love.</p>\\n<p>We need to do our part to act with love and not give in to the fear and frenzy; that is the goal of terror-ism after all.</p>\\n<p>Find a way to rise above this battle. I believe that's what Jesus would do.</p>\\n<p>This poem was written during the Harlem Renaissance but it still speaks volumes today:</p>\\n<h3>I, Too</h3>\\n<p>BY LANGSTON HUGHES</p>\\n<p>I, too, sing America.\\nI am the darker brother.\\nThey send me to eat in the kitchen\\nWhen company comes,\\nBut I laugh,\\nAnd eat well,\\nAnd grow strong.\\nTomorrow,\\nIll be at the table\\nWhen company comes.\\nNobodyll dare\\nSay to me,\\nEat in the kitchen,\\nThen.\\nBesides,\\nTheyll see how beautiful I am\\nAnd be ashamed\\nI, too, am America.</p>\\n<p>Find the poem <a

due date was Monday, November fourteenth. I woke up and went to work just like any other day- except this day I was hoping to not return home. I had hopes for a natural birth. The doctors told me I was young and healthy, this was going to be great. I kept telling my coworkers I thought my water was going to break; a woman just knows when somethings not 'normal' down there. Late into the night I got into bed and felt a warm gush... just like the doctor said I would. Then we were off! I was so incredibly excited yet calm. We texted, called, and emailed family and coworkers. Life was about to change and I just had no idea what to expect.</p>\\n<p>We parked in the parking garage and I felt a sense of pride that I could still walk around, although I was definitely leaving a mess behind. My husband made me ride in a wheelchair, which was probably the best idea. He's good at being kind to me.</p>\\n<p>The hospital was eerily quiet, but it was two in the morning. No contractions started so the doctors had me pacing the hallways in my fancy hospital socks. One hour, two hours, nothing. And then came my first unexpected blow: we need to induce you. Sorry, you're not progressing.</p>\\n<p>Five hours later and still less than halfway dilated. My heart dropped to the floor when the doctor (the first of three) told me this was going to be an evening baby and the sun had barely just risen. I had no energy left at this point. Then came unexpected blow number two: I asked for the epidural.</p>\\n<p>Time passed in a haze as I lay in the hospital bed, contracting but barely feeling anything but a heaviness, listening to a repeating soundtrack my husband put on as a distraction. People kept bringing him food; I was beyond envious he didn't have to live through the day like I did.</p>\\n<p>Late into the evening there was a doctor, a nurse, two nurse interns, and my husband all in the room when my doctor said the biggest unexpected blow number three: you might want to consider a c-section at this point. Baby is not dropping and you seem to not be dilated beyond eight centimeters. That's when the tears came. And the vomit. Did I mention all the vomit? They said it was the medication, lack of food, hormones... either way it sucked. I was so desperate for relief and afraid the baby would never come so I said yes. And I don't regret my decision, I just feel sad for the way I experienced it.</p>\\n<p>I remember telling Jacob in the hospital that I was never having another baby. We were adopting. That is that. Everyone said I would change my mind... but I think i'm still working through the trauma of it all. We want Eli to have a sibling: to learn how to share and live in community. I just don't know if I can handle that experience again. When you battle anxiety and depression, mixed with wacky hormones, throw in an unexpected emergency surgery, oh and a real life baby: you get fear. I have lived with fear since the moment he was born. Please don't misunderstand, I have joy. I love that child more than I love myself. But there is a degree of fear underlying my thoughts I can't quite put my finger on.</p>\\n<p>Today and every day I try to live in the present. I try to hold him and rock him to sleep and not to rush this time of life together. I pray, I ask for guidance, call the doctor all the time, and try not to take myself too seriously.</p>\\n<p>We sure did get lucky with a baby who still smiles at me even though he can't breathe out of his nose right now. My grandma told me he was going to bring a lot of joy into our lives and she was correct. Despite my fear, despite my uncertainty, he is teaching me to just sit there and giggle with him.</p>\\n<p>Welcome to this crazy world Eli William!</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c5I1fMVhdew0GemeMWoEKS6\",\"title\":\"In the Mirror\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"G69JOFlSIogQYAiS0mW0G\",\"category\":\"Emotions\"},{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"},{\"id\":\"c2zAmsqajH2gqq2yiaIsGYK\",\"category\":\"Women's Issues\"}],\"slug\":\"in-the-mirror\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.5007235890014472,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=400&h=267&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=800&h=533&q=50 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=1200&h=800&q=50 1200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=1600&h=1066&q=50 1600w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=2074&h=1382&q=50 2074w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=200&h=133&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=400&h=267&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=800&h=533&q=50&fm=webp 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=1200&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 1200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=1600&h=1066&q=50&fm=webp 1600w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg?w=2074&h=1382&q=50&fm=webp 2074w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2LbsUXv0LeaWmYc08S4YYo/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"jp5rutrnaes-mark-rabe-min.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Every night when I am awoken by little hunger cries I roll out of bed, grab my sweater and head down the nightlight-lit hall to the nursery. I look down at the little boy wincing in his bassinet, pick him up, and gently kiss him on his forehead. In complete silence, with exception of his white noise machine, I change his diaper, re-swaddle, head to the rocking chair, and begin to nurse him back to comfort. We sit by the glow of Christmas lights. Just the two of us.</p>\\n<p>We're still getting to know each other.</p>\\n<p>He recognizes the sound of my voice and the smell of my skin. He just started turning his head towards me when I speak.</p>\\n<p>I am learning the meaning of his different cries. The hunger cries, the painful cries, the cries of boredom, and the desire for comfort.</p>\\n<p>When we first brought him home I didn't know if I could do it. I couldn't soothe him every time he fussed. I wasn't sure if he was hungry, uncomfortable, scared. My body hurt from the c-section and the drop in hormone levels left me with a floodgate of tears and nervousness.My husband and Iheard phantom cries every time we went into a different room and sometimes took turns outside with the dog just to get a break from the crying.</p>\\n<p>During our first week together in the middle of the night I was rocking my son for what seemed like hours. He wasn't crying but wasn't sleeping either. I was so tired; my lower back was aching from holding him in the same position, afraid that if I moved him he would never fall asleep. Then I caught a glimpse of our silhouette in the bedroom mirror. I could see the outline of my messy hair and bad posture. In my arms I was holding a baby. My baby. My child.</p>\\n<p>This is me, this is my identity now. Mother. It's my duty and purpose to be awake in the early hours of the morning rocking our son;could this be real? My reflection confirms my thoughts.</p>\\n<p>Every night I pass the mirror and see myself with a baby in my arms. Sometimes I just stop and stare... is that really me? Is this really us? It's like I want to seal the memory in my mind. It's a sacred moment, my son and me together in the dark.</p>\\n<p>Every day we learn a little more and life gets a little easier. Nothing is perfect but everything we are experiencing is perfectly human. I am thankful.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c6dfXLxkndK8g4osEywauG0\",\"title\":\"My Marriage: What I've Learned & What I Need to

honor of my husband's birthday this month I want to reflect a bit on our marriage,our sweet love story, and what I've learned through relationship.</p>\\n<p>I write this in almost every wedding card we give: <strong>Marriage is my favorite part of life right now.</strong> It's so amazing to live with your best friend, wake up to him every morning, cook with him or for him, hold hands, and live life knowing you have someone who fully supports and loves you. Some say, \\\"you're still in the honeymoon phase, just wait ten years\\\". We've heard that one before. Or, \\\"oh, it won't last\\\". Let me preface this post with some disclaimers and insights into my life.</p>\\n<p>First, I am not a marriage expert and would never claim to be. I am just blessed to be in a great marriage that honors the Lord and has a strong foundation. Secondly, while we've only been married less than three years, Jacob and I have been together almost six years and friends for nine years. I do believe the time spent together and growing together has given me tremendous knowledge about relationship. Lastly, our relationship is not without conflict. We spent the first two years of dating fighting almost on a weekly basis. Tears, angry phone calls, lack of trust, you name it. Long distance isn't the easiest. Conflict is included in my definition of a healthy relationship. In fact, the other day we gave each other the silent treatment for over an hour... it happens. It's only how you grow through the conflict that matters. I realize now I am writing this post as much for myself as for others. I need these remindersto look back on when life gets tough; when my anxiety levels rise and I need direction.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say, I do not believe the naysayers who claim love doesn't last, the honeymoon phase can't possibly last. I know too many people who are in strong committed relationships after ten, twenty, thirty years. In fact, I'm completely excited to grow old together. I want to be with him when our kids graduate high school, when we retire from work. I want to take care of him if he ever gets sick; live up to my vows through sickness and in health. It is my hope that through our relationship we can grow as individuals and be an example of the Lord's love on earth.</p>\\n<p>Since the moment I met Jacob when I was 15 (he was a cool college kid by then), I felt something special. We had an instant connection. He was attracted to my, let's say, beauty. And I just thought he was a goofy kid I loved to be around. It didn't take long for us to develop feelings for each other but life got in the way: other relationships, school, my fear of boys, and even family. I always knew somehow we'd end up together- soul mates? Who knows.</p>\\n<p>My friends would see us interact at college and constantly told me he was in love with me. I brushed it off. My grandmother sensed his affection for me and knew it was strong, I wasn't ready to hear it. I avoided Jacob when he started writing me letters and wanting to spend more time together. It was too real, too fast. Then he had a dream.</p>\\n<p>I really do believe God can speak through our dreams and this is a great example. He had a dream about me, and he took that as a sign it might be time to pursue more than a friendship. And for the first time in years I didn't completely resist him.</p>\\n<p>I credit Jacob for the traditional-ness of our relationship. I can't think of any other way to say it but he always tries to do the right thing. He asked my dad if he could date me, he waited patiently until I was ready, he didn't kiss me for almost three months after we started dating,and asked me if he could kiss me one night under the stars. He stressed respect, physical boundaries, communication, and honesty. I'm not sure how he got so wise but I have learned more from him about relationships than any book, sermon, tv show, or friend. To my wonderful mother and father in law, if you're reading this, you did something right!</p>\\n<p><strong>Six things I've learned from marriage:</strong></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>It is a reflection of the Lord's love and grace for us. It is through my marriage I've come to a deeper understanding of grace and forgiveness. Through marriage we can show the world God's design for family and relationship. It is through marriage we practice the love of the Lord on earth and show others that by His strength we can endure hardships. I've needed a lot of grace from Jacob over the years. I have struggles and he has struggles. By requiring so much grace and love from him I believe I've learned better how to give it and also receive it from the Lord.</li>\\n<li>My husband is loved by God. He is a child of God. I once heard a preacher say when you get married, God also becomes your father-in-law. Your spouse first belonged to the Lord and they are still cherished by their heavenly father. That really puts it into perspective for me. I love and value my spouse but God loves and values them more than I could ever understand. This principle is true for everyone in our lives, not just our spouses.</li>\\n<li>Love is a decision. I'm sure you've heard that before... but do you know its depth? Love is a commitment and a commitment I have to learn to choose even on the hard days. I have to choose to respond in love when all I want to do is scream and yell at Jacob and tell him how many ways he messed up. I have to choose to respond in love when he confesses something to me that hurts my feelings. I have to stick on love's side when he tells me how I've hurt him or ways I could grow as a person. Sometimes I don't respond in love right away. Sometimes I have to come back an hour or a day later and apologize for what I said or didn't say. That's the beauty of grace and forgiveness. We are both imperfect in our imperfect-ness. Commitmentis the only way love works.</li>\\n<li>Marriage is stinkin' hard but it's so unbelievably worth it. Life is not meant to be lived alone. We were created for our partner and our partner was created for us. If you're not married or don't plan on getting married, then switch the word 'marriage' with 'relationship'. Relationships can be so difficult but we were created for community!</li>\\n</ol>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The person who tries to live alone will not succeed as a human being. His heart withers if it does not answer another heart. His mind shrinks away if he hears only the echoes of his own thoughts and finds no other inspiration. -Pearl S. Buck</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<ol start=\\\"5\\\">\\n<li>We are both our own person. We were Jacob and Ashley, two distinctly unique human beings before we were married, and we are those same people today. Jacob has his own desires, wants, talents, and so do I. I do not own him. I cannot change him. He cannot make me fit any mold. We are who we are individually and together; and together we create something really special when we allow each other to be our own.</li>\\n<li>No other human being will ever fill the hole in my heart. C.S. Lewis referred to it as a 'God shaped hole'. It's so unfair for me to expect my husband to meet all my needs and fill every gaping wound in my soul. In fact, when I'm feeling down and angry at Jacob for not meeting one of my needs I have to stop and ask myself if there is a lack in my relationship with the Lord first. Am I expecting this person to make me feel whole when no human relationship was intended to do that? My grandmother always told me those close to you are your easiest targets for taking out any negative feelings. Boy was she right.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Here's to you Jacob; I'm thankful for your 28 years of life and for choosing me to share the journey with you. Thank you for being committed to our marriage and for giving me security and love like I've never known.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"tOQlNA9lyoskcoUgqMEqm\",\"title\":\"Between Life & Death\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c5ORZhJRBfiwcyiOEMACoGK\",\"category\":\"Depression\"},{\"id\":\"G69JOFlSIogQYAiS0mW0G\",\"category\":\"Emotions\"},{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"}],\"slug\":\"between-life-death\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png\",\"fileName\":\"052819-1.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>I'm sitting here on my balcony looking at the last little triangle of sunlight shining on a tree as it sets behind us.

Grandma is dying.</p>\\n<p>It's hard to live life when there's so much good and so much bad.</p>\\n<p>Living between anticipated new life and anticipated death is a weird space. And both are completely new to me. That's scary. I have no idea what it's like to give birth or to be a mother; and I have no idea what it's like to lose someone I truly love with all my soul.

You will probably not need any medication and in fact, your hormone levels might stabilize and you'll never need medication again.\\\" That is not a direct quote but rather the gist of the conversation. I was skeptical of this projection; but really hoping and praying those words were true.</p>\\n<p>For me, they weren't.</p>\\n<p>In fact, my anxiety became unmanageable after my doctor told me to quickly ween of all medication and just suck it up. Maybe the pregnancy would give me more 'motivation'. Needless to say I was terrified, angry, and desperate for relief and peace.</p>\\n<p>All I could think about was how in the world was I suppose to be a mother when I could barely find the motivation to get through the day, let alone smile.</p>\\n<p>Since then I have sought the opinion of three other doctors (one of them being a highly-qualified specialist in maternal infant health psychiatry). I am back on a steady dose of medication, saw my therapist for a couple months, and feeling overall huge improvements.</p>\\n<p>I lost myself for a month. I was unable to enjoy and fully celebrate the fact I was creating life inside me because the worry, anxiety, and depression completely took over. If you are ever in a similar situation; seek multiple opinions. Ultimately you will know what's best. Most often the best decision is the one where you feel whole and complete. That's what my child needs; a mother who can be present, whole, complete, and peaceful.</p>\\n<p>Since finding out we were going to have a baby, life has gotten crazy. We realized we needed to move... a tiny 400 square-foot apartment with a baby and a black lab just wasn't how I wanted to spend my time. Thus began the searching and moving process.</p>\\n<p>Almost four months into my pregnancy I was driving home from work and was hit by a man trying to cross five lanes of traffic, right into the drivers side. That resulted in a multitude of medical tests and tears, all of which came back fine. We are praising the Lord for that!</p>\\n<p>Then my husband found out some not-so-encouraging medical news, which has completely upped my stress level.</p>\\n<p>Then our doggie hurt his paw and had to go to the emergency vet and wear the cone of shame for a whole week. He was even on dog narcotics! It was sad but almost comical to watch.</p>\\n<p>Then we bought our new car and it's already in the shop. We've owned it for four days.</p>\\n<p>I forgot to mention in the midst of all this I started a new job and Jacob is having trouble at his work. When my husband, who is always the calm one, is constantly stressed it really throws us for a loop.</p>\\n<p>My beloved grandmother is going through a possible cancer-scare, which has our whole family in tense waiting.</p>\\n<p>We are moving to a completely new city in a month and a half.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say I am so thankful for the medication I am able to take to help me cope with life lately. I am even more thankful for the Lord's constant provision and peace. <a href=\\\"https://bible.org/seriespage/60-compound-names-jehovah-jireh-rapha-nissi\\\">Jehovah-jireh</a>, the Lord provides. My favorite saying and my favorite truth to live day by day.</p>\\n<p>\\\"The Revelation of the Name <strong>Jehovah-Jireh</strong>, Genesis 22:12-14. The meaning of this name is The Lord Who Provides. The name is literally, The Lord Who Sees, or The Lord Who Will See To It. This is what we long for when we have a need that is personal and special; One who will see to our needs and provide for us. This is what Jehovah-Jireh means; the Lord Who will see to it that my every need is met. One Who knows my need because He sees.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Regular life stress can be really difficult for someone dealing with an anxiety disorder. What some can brush of and 'not worry about' can consume others. We have to be patient with those around us who we don't fully understand. I can't even express how much patience and compassion are necessary to help me through any struggle.</p>\\n<p>On a positive note, we are just days away from finding out the gender! Will we need a pink or blue nursery??</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"GJIfENJHCUkEk28SW6s4w\",\"title\":\"My Recent Lessons From God\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"c3J6WDpW41Wew4Wwecsy0cc\",\"category\":\"Faith\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"},{\"id\":\"c2zAmsqajH2gqq2yiaIsGYK\",\"category\":\"Women's Issues\"}],\"slug\":\"my-recent-lessons-from-god\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.5105740181268883,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=200&h=132&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=400&h=265&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&h=530&q=50 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=1000&h=662&q=50 1000w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=200&h=132&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=400&h=265&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&h=530&q=50&fm=webp 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=1000&h=662&q=50&fm=webp 1000w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"blogpost1.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>I've gotten into a spiritual rut lately (I'm talking months and months here)- constantly praying to know God more, to feel his presence, to trust him more, to see his beauty around me. It't not always easy to find the motivation or sense of urgency to study his Word and truly submit myself in prayer. Most days I don't 'feel' like it and honestly, I've had the thought \\\"if the Lord wants me to know him better, he will reveal himself to me.\\\"</p>\\n<p>I recently went to my first women's retreat with church. I was hoping to learn something new and exciting but instead I was reminded of something I already knew but has completely pushed out of my mind: Those who seek the Lord find him when they seek him with all their hearts (Jeremiah 29:13). You mean I actually have to put effort into this?</p>\\n<p>Yes, yes I do. You do, too.</p>\\n<p>\\\"God provides everything we need, we have to avail ourselves to the things he provided.\\\" -April Barrett</p>\\n<p>I want to encourage you if you have a faith life but need to grow spiritually- it's time to take action. This morning I had some free time before my day started. To read Harry Potter or not to read Harry Potter... then I saw my devotional book sitting on the shelf. I didn't really feel like reading something serious but I paused and had a thought: my emotions and feelings can be deceiving. Just because I don't feel like something doesn't mean it's not right. I picked up the devotional and I so clearly heard from the Lord. The title was <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Utmost-His-Highest-Oswald-Chambers/dp/1572937378/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&#x26;dpID=41fpis7rWdL&#x26;dpSrc=sims&#x26;preST=_AC_UL320_SR214%2C320_&#x26;refRID=0FJ9A79WTX8Y862NFK3P\\\">\\\"Insight Not Emotion\\\".</a></p>\\n<p>\\\"If we try to reintroduce the rare moments of inspirations, it is a sign that it is not God we want. We are making a fetish of the moments when God did come and speak, and insisting that He must do it again; whereas what God wants us to do is to walk by faith...We must never make our moments of inspiration our standard; our standard is our duty.\\\"</p>\\n<p>The standard of my moments with the Lord and the knowledge of his presence in my life is my duty. Wow. <strong>In order to achieve oneness with him I have to make an effort, an actual effort.</strong> Moments of inspiration from the Lord are such a gift. This devotional says God will give us touches of his inspiration when we are not in danger of being led away by them. I really look forward to those moments when I can distinctly hear the voice of the Lord. They reassure my faith but they do not sustain it.</p>\\n<p>I love my husband every day not just the moments when he sweeps me off my feet and takes my breath away. Those occasions are special and rare; and that's the way I want it.</p>\\n<p>It's so hard to make time for something when we lack inspiration. I personally struggle with that. However, I still brush my teeth every day and do the dishes (not quite every day...). I just do it because it's the right thing to do. I brush my teeth because I want to care for my body and prevent future issues. I wash dishes because I like a clean home and don't want to smell the rot of old food.</p>\\n<p>Similarly, we can view our spiritual lives that way. We need to get rid of the rot and the stink that sometimes fills up our lives and a great way to do that is by seeking the Lord. But really, truly, seeking him.</p>\\n<p>I'm still working on this. Life can be so absolutely crazy I am thankful for the constant presence of God even when I lack motivation to seek him. That's how much he love us!</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c50J6syQf1YS4I2WkQI4YaO\",\"title\":\"If You're Going Through Hell\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c5ORZhJRBfiwcyiOEMACoGK\",\"category\":\"Depression\"},{\"id\":\"G69JOFlSIogQYAiS0mW0G\",\"category\":\"Emotions\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"}],\"slug\":\"if-youre-going-through-hell\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.4989293361884368,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=400&h=267&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=700&h=467&q=50 700w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=200&h=133&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=400&h=267&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=700&h=467&q=50&fm=webp 700w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Ever have those days, weeks, maybe even months when you are just in a funk?

am having trouble coming to terms with my radical, conservative, equal rights, homophobic, socialist, universalist, Christian, anti-gun, pro-life, Republican, left-winged, peace-loving, Jesus following, gay-marriage supporting, heterosexual, Bible thumping self.</p>\\n<p>So many thoughts, so many gray areas, so I wait.</p>\\n<p>I wait for guidance from the Father.</p>\\n<p>I wait to act on my beliefs and convictions until I hear and feel the clear voice of Someone omnipotent.</p>\\n<p>Some answers I have received. Some answers seem to change as I mature and expand my horizons. Some answers have not wavered although outside pressures direct me elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>There are red-lettered answers in my Bible. As I read them I can picture Jesus standing in a crowd, teaching his followers with his dirty sandals and unkempt hair. He doesn't notice his appearance because he is more focused on the beggar at the street corner.</p>\\n<p>I desperately want to be like that. I want to look past people's sexual orientations, political persuasions, past-lives, and addictions. I want to see their soul and meet them where they are like Jesus did.</p>\\n<p>I was first introduced to Christianity at a Baptist church. Women were expected to wear skirts and not to say \\\"darn\\\" (too close to the real thing). That's all I knew; and I was taught the most important thing in life is everyone say the ABC prayer before they die.</p>\\n<p>Accept Jesus. Believe he died for you. Confess your sins. BAM. Saved.</p>\\n<p>I developed a fearful and judgmental attitude towards anyone whowas a \\\"non-Christian\\\".</p>\\n<p>I am thankful for that experience because it's where I first stood in the presence of the Lord and that has changed my life. I am thankful to have an understanding of how many conservative Christians think. And I am also thankful to have grown out of that mindset, realizing knowing the Lord is an issue of the heart not a matter of aformula.</p>\\n<p>But now, here I sit, a twenty-something Christian living in modern day America. My heart and mind are torn between tradition, family beliefs, political ideologies, and religion.</p>\\n<p>I love the Lord.</p>\\n<p>I love people.</p>\\n<p>I don't have the same attitude and feelings as some of my family members. And that's okay.</p>\\n<p>I have to admit, one of my guilty pleasures is starting debates with those who have very strong political persuasions. My goal is to convince my father I'm voting for Hilary Clinton. He might not be able to sleep at night, but it's too funny to resist.</p>\\n<p>I'm left with questions: who would Jesus vote for? What would modern-day American Jesus do with his free time? How would he minister?</p>\\n<p>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</p>\\n<p>James 1:27</p>\\n<p>I'm a seeker of the Lord who will keep on seekin'.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c3wzTVOZhfWSweeIIgAWMoW\",\"title\":\"Save Your Venom\",\"category\":[{\"id\":\"DQhgzBjOlaW6Es8KaCkuW\",\"category\":\"Anxiety\"},{\"id\":\"c5ORZhJRBfiwcyiOEMACoGK\",\"category\":\"Depression\"},{\"id\":\"G69JOFlSIogQYAiS0mW0G\",\"category\":\"Emotions\"},{\"id\":\"c2i0ovn4Ms0K6A0kqWCaq2q\",\"category\":\"Life\"},{\"id\":\"c2zAmsqajH2gqq2yiaIsGYK\",\"category\":\"Women's Issues\"}],\"slug\":\"save-your-venom\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"happy-new-year.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Since I got an iPhone last year, I've been pretty obsessed with podcasts. My current favorites are Serial and Heather Dubrow's World. I listen to them every week while I walk the dog, drive in the car, or go to the gym. Earlier this week I was listening once again as I happily worked out on the spin bike (okay fine, I was sweating profusely and constantly staring at the 30 minute timer willing it to end). Anyways, I heard a podcast with and the featured guest was <a href=\\\"http://kristiling.com/\\\">Kristi Ling</a>, the happiness strategist. I really don't like the word 'happy' because it's such a fluffy word. It just sounds so shallow to me.</p>\\n<p>Everyone wants to be happy, find their happiness, find someone to make them happy.</p>\\n<p>When I heard this lady who is an expert on happiness was coming on to the show I wasn't expecting much...honestly. However, she had great points and great ideas- I was so inspired I decided to write about it. I actually, perhaps, maybe, will consider buying her newest book.</p>\\n<p>Kristi Ling wears a rattlesnake ring every day. Kind of a weird piece of jewelry if you ask me. For her, it's a daily reminder to 'save her venom'.</p>\\n<p>Rattlesnakes have very poisonous venom. They need it to kill their prey so they can eat and survive. If approached by a threat, the snake will not strike. They wait until they are absolutely sure their very life is being threatened. Why? They need to save their venom! If they don't preserve their supply, they won't have it when they really need it. It's a waste.</p>\\n<p>I LOVE THIS ANALOGY.</p>\\n<p>I need to save my venom! It so perfectly relates to those struggling with anxiety. We get so anxious and freaked out by what-ifs all the time. Our fight or flight responses kick in and we go into hyper drive. For me, it doesn't matter if there is a real dangerous threat, my venom is ready to strike at any hint of fear.</p>\\n<p>The other day I was driving in the car and started to become consumed with worry that my car would break down and I would have no way to get to work. I started thinking about how we would pay for repairs, could we afford a new car, would Jacob be able to drive me to work in the morning?</p>\\n<p>Then I paused and remembered the rattlesnake. I want to be a rattlesnake. I want to save my venom.

Many are throwing ideas out there like all Muslim's should be deported until further questioning or Muslim immigration should not be allowed. People are making jokes about needing to build a fence to keep the Arabs out and not the Mexicans. Some are spreading anger and wanting to act with un-just violence.</p>\\n<p>Terrorism is real but to say that all Muslims need to be under scrutiny or leave the countryis like saying all adolescent white males who like video games are potentially mass-shooters and we should probably deport them until further notice.</p>\\n<p>If you haven't heard, there have been over 52 school shootings this year. The majority by white, middle-upper class males.</p>\\n<p>That is tragedy. Terrorism is tragedy. This world is full of tragedy. How can we combat this? I don't know. I do know it's not by actingfrom a place of fear or ignorance.</p>\\n<p>Every year in American history there have been racial tensions. Every decade there's a new group that's ostracized and stereotyped.</p>\\n<p>Native Americans were originally considered savages.</p>\\n<p>In 1902 Chinese immigration was made permanently illegal.</p>\\n<p>When Irish immigrants first came to the United States they were ridiculed and forced into slums.</p>\\n<p>In the 1920's Germans were seen as an evil threat, people were afraid they had radical political beliefs and would be the downfall of American society as we knew it. Some were deported, arrested, and probably tortured.</p>\\n<p>Jim Crow laws were practiced from the 1880's until 1965, and African Americans were seen as lesser for centuries. Some people still think this way.</p>\\n<p>Today we are fearful of illegal immigrants who are \\\"stealing our jobs and corrupting our county\\\" because they want a better life for their precious children and can't afford the legal application process. (I met a Guatemalan woman who has applied for a visa for her elderly mother at least three times, each time it was denied. She might not be able to afford to pay to apply again.)</p>\\n<p>Now we want to deport Muslims because we have fear they are weakening our great nation: just like the Native Americans, the Chinese, the Germans, the Blacks.</p>\\n<p>I work with Muslims. I buy groceries from them. I wave to them on the street while we are walking our dogs together. I take Zumba class with Muslim women; we talk about how much we would rather be eating french fries. I see them without their scarves on and feel like I know them in a secret way. They are real people with real lives.</p>\\n<p>I am aware I am not a military strategist. I don't understand all politics and I don't mean to say all people feel this way. I know some who do, and I can assure you know someone like this too. Someone who is acting from fear and not love.</p>\\n<p>We need to do our part to act with love and not give in to the fear and frenzy; that is the goal of terror-ism after all.</p>\\n<p>Find a way to rise above this battle. I believe that's what Jesus would do.</p>\\n<p>This poem was written during the Harlem Renaissance but it still speaks volumes today:</p>\\n<h3>I, Too</h3>\\n<p>BY LANGSTON HUGHES</p>\\n<p>I, too, sing America.\\nI am the darker brother.\\nThey send me to eat in the kitchen\\nWhen company comes,\\nBut I laugh,\\nAnd eat well,\\nAnd grow strong.\\nTomorrow,\\nIll be at the table\\nWhen company comes.\\nNobodyll dare\\nSay to me,\\nEat in the kitchen,\\nThen.\\nBesides,\\nTheyll see how beautiful I am\\nAnd be ashamed\\nI, too, am America.</p>\\n<p>Find the poem <a href=\\\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/177020\\\">here.</a></p>\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{\"category\":\"Life\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/categories-life.json\n// module id = 330\n// module chunks = 240137944644922"],"sourceRoot":""}
