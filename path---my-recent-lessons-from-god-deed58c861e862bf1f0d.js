It't not always easy to find the motivation or sense of urgency to study his Word and truly submit myself in prayer. Most days I don't 'feel' like it and honestly, I've had the thought \"if the Lord wants me to know him better, he will reveal himself to me.\"</p>\n<p>I recently went to my first women's retreat with church. I was hoping to learn something new and exciting but instead I was reminded of something I already knew but has completely pushed out of my mind: Those who seek the Lord find him when they seek him with all their hearts (Jeremiah 29:13). You mean I actually have to put effort into this?</p>\n<p>Yes, yes I do. You do, too.</p>\n<p>\"God provides everything we need, we have to avail ourselves to the things he provided.\" -April Barrett</p>\n<p>I want to encourage you if you have a faith life but need to grow spiritually- it's time to take action. This morning I had some free time before my day started. To read Harry Potter or not to read Harry Potter... then I saw my devotional book sitting on the shelf. I didn't really feel like reading something serious but I paused and had a thought: my emotions and feelings can be deceiving. Just because I don't feel like something doesn't mean it's not right. I picked up the devotional and I so clearly heard from the Lord. The title was <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Utmost-His-Highest-Oswald-Chambers/dp/1572937378/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&#x26;dpID=41fpis7rWdL&#x26;dpSrc=sims&#x26;preST=_AC_UL320_SR214%2C320_&#x26;refRID=0FJ9A79WTX8Y862NFK3P\">\"Insight Not Emotion\".</a></p>\n<p>\"If we try to reintroduce the rare moments of inspirations, it is a sign that it is not God we want. We are making a fetish of the moments when God did come and speak, and insisting that He must do it again; whereas what God wants us to do is to walk by faith...We must never make our moments of inspiration our standard; our standard is our duty.\"</p>\n<p>The standard of my moments with the Lord and the knowledge of his presence in my life is my duty. Wow. <strong>In order to achieve oneness with him I have to make an effort, an actual effort.</strong> Moments of inspiration from the Lord are such a gift. This devotional says God will give us touches of his inspiration when we are not in danger of being led away by them. I really look forward to those moments when I can distinctly hear the voice of the Lord. They reassure my faith but they do not sustain it.</p>\n<p>I love my husband every day not just the moments when he sweeps me off my feet and takes my breath away. Those occasions are special and rare; and that's the way I want it.</p>\n<p>It's so hard to make time for something when we lack inspiration. I personally struggle with that. However, I still brush my teeth every day and do the dishes (not quite every day...). I just do it because it's the right thing to do. I brush my teeth because I want to care for my body and prevent future issues. I wash dishes because I like a clean home and don't want to smell the rot of old food.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we can view our spiritual lives that way. We need to get rid of the rot and the stink that sometimes fills up our lives and a great way to do that is by seeking the Lord. But really, truly, seeking him.</p>\n<p>I'm still working on this. Life can be so absolutely crazy I am thankful for the constant presence of God even when I lack motivation to seek him. That's how much he love us!</p>"}}}},pathContext:{slug:"my-recent-lessons-from-god"}}}});
