due date was Monday, November fourteenth. I woke up and went to work just like any other day- except this day I was hoping to not return home. I had hopes for a natural birth. The doctors told me I was young and healthy, this was going to be great. I kept telling my coworkers I thought my water was going to break; a woman just knows when somethings not 'normal' down there. Late into the night I got into bed and felt a warm gush... just like the doctor said I would. Then we were off! I was so incredibly excited yet calm. We texted, called, and emailed family and coworkers. Life was about to change and I just had no idea what to expect.</p>\n<p>We parked in the parking garage and I felt a sense of pride that I could still walk around, although I was definitely leaving a mess behind. My husband made me ride in a wheelchair, which was probably the best idea. He's good at being kind to me.</p>\n<p>The hospital was eerily quiet, but it was two in the morning. No contractions started so the doctors had me pacing the hallways in my fancy hospital socks. One hour, two hours, nothing. And then came my first unexpected blow: we need to induce you. Sorry, you're not progressing.</p>\n<p>Five hours later and still less than halfway dilated. My heart dropped to the floor when the doctor (the first of three) told me this was going to be an evening baby and the sun had barely just risen. I had no energy left at this point. Then came unexpected blow number two: I asked for the epidural.</p>\n<p>Time passed in a haze as I lay in the hospital bed, contracting but barely feeling anything but a heaviness, listening to a repeating soundtrack my husband put on as a distraction. People kept bringing him food; I was beyond envious he didn't have to live through the day like I did.</p>\n<p>Late into the evening there was a doctor, a nurse, two nurse interns, and my husband all in the room when my doctor said the biggest unexpected blow number three: you might want to consider a c-section at this point. Baby is not dropping and you seem to not be dilated beyond eight centimeters. That's when the tears came. And the vomit. Did I mention all the vomit? They said it was the medication, lack of food, hormones... either way it sucked. I was so desperate for relief and afraid the baby would never come so I said yes. And I don't regret my decision, I just feel sad for the way I experienced it.</p>\n<p>I remember telling Jacob in the hospital that I was never having another baby. We were adopting. That is that. Everyone said I would change my mind... but I think i'm still working through the trauma of it all. We want Eli to have a sibling: to learn how to share and live in community. I just don't know if I can handle that experience again. When you battle anxiety and depression, mixed with wacky hormones, throw in an unexpected emergency surgery, oh and a real life baby: you get fear. I have lived with fear since the moment he was born. Please don't misunderstand, I have joy. I love that child more than I love myself. But there is a degree of fear underlying my thoughts I can't quite put my finger on.</p>\n<p>Today and every day I try to live in the present. I try to hold him and rock him to sleep and not to rush this time of life together. I pray, I ask for guidance, call the doctor all the time, and try not to take myself too seriously.</p>\n<p>We sure did get lucky with a baby who still smiles at me even though he can't breathe out of his nose right now.

I look down at the little boy wincing in his bassinet, pick him up, and gently kiss him on his forehead. In complete silence, with exception of his white noise machine, I change his diaper, re-swaddle, head to the rocking chair, and begin to nurse him back to comfort.

He wasn't crying but wasn't sleeping either. I was so tired; my lower back was aching from holding him in the same position, afraid that if I moved him he would never fall asleep.

No line, no change in color, so I set it on the counter and started to brush my teeth. Didn't want to be late for work. I happened to glance back down at it before throwing it in the trash and I saw the beginning of a pink streak.</p>\n<p>OH MY GOSH. (those weren't the exact words that came out...)</p>\n<p>If my years working at a pregnancy center taught me anything it was that any pink line meant something was going on. This was real.</p>\n<p>I always had the vision I would find out I was pregnant, keep it from my husband until I could come up with some cute little baby surprise and wow him. Well, none of that happens in real life.</p>\n<p>I instantly woke him up, tried to get words out through my hyper breathing, and told him what the test said. He replied with a slobbery lisp through his nighttime mouth guard, \"Are you serious?\".</p>\n<p>Pure romance.</p>\n<p>I was told about three years ago from a doctor, \"Once you get pregnant, your anxiety will significantly improve. You will probably not need any medication and in fact, your hormone levels might stabilize and you'll never need medication again.\" That is not a direct quote but rather the gist of the conversation. I was skeptical of this projection; but really hoping and praying those words were true.</p>\n<p>For me, they weren't.</p>\n<p>In fact, my anxiety became unmanageable after my doctor told me to quickly ween of all medication and just suck it up. Maybe the pregnancy would give me more 'motivation'. Needless to say I was terrified, angry, and desperate for relief and peace.</p>\n<p>All I could think about was how in the world was I suppose to be a mother when I could barely find the motivation to get through the day, let alone smile.</p>\n<p>Since then I have sought the opinion of three other doctors (one of them being a highly-qualified specialist in maternal infant health psychiatry). I am back on a steady dose of medication, saw my therapist for a couple months, and feeling overall huge improvements.</p>\n<p>I lost myself for a month. I was unable to enjoy and fully celebrate the fact I was creating life inside me because the worry, anxiety, and depression completely took over. If you are ever in a similar situation; seek multiple opinions. Ultimately you will know what's best. Most often the best decision is the one where you feel whole and complete. That's what my child needs; a mother who can be present, whole, complete, and peaceful.</p>\n<p>Since finding out we were going to have a baby, life has gotten crazy. We realized we needed to move... a tiny 400 square-foot apartment with a baby and a black lab just wasn't how I wanted to spend my time. Thus began the searching and moving process.</p>\n<p>Almost four months into my pregnancy I was driving home from work and was hit by a man trying to cross five lanes of traffic, right into the drivers side. That resulted in a multitude of medical tests and tears, all of which came back fine. We are praising the Lord for that!</p>\n<p>Then my husband found out some not-so-encouraging medical news, which has completely upped my stress level.</p>\n<p>Then our doggie hurt his paw and had to go to the emergency vet and wear the cone of shame for a whole week. He was even on dog narcotics! It was sad but almost comical to watch.</p>\n<p>Then we bought our new car and it's already in the shop. We've owned it for four days.</p>\n<p>I forgot to mention in the midst of all this I started a new job and Jacob is having trouble at his work. When my husband, who is always the calm one, is constantly stressed it really throws us for a loop.</p>\n<p>My beloved grandmother is going through a possible cancer-scare, which has our whole family in tense waiting.</p>\n<p>We are moving to a completely new city in a month and a half.</p>\n<p>Needless to say I am so thankful for the medication I am able to take to help me cope with life lately. I am even more thankful for the Lord's constant provision and peace. <a href=\"https://bible.org/seriespage/60-compound-names-jehovah-jireh-rapha-nissi\">Jehovah-jireh</a>, the Lord provides. My favorite saying and my favorite truth to live day by day.</p>\n<p>\"The Revelation of the Name <strong>Jehovah-Jireh</strong>, Genesis 22:12-14. The meaning of this name is The Lord Who Provides. The name is literally, The Lord Who Sees, or The Lord Who Will See To It. This is what we long for when we have a need that is personal and special; One who will see to our needs and provide for us. This is what Jehovah-Jireh means; the Lord Who will see to it that my every need is met. One Who knows my need because He sees.\"</p>\n<p>Regular life stress can be really difficult for someone dealing with an anxiety disorder. What some can brush of and 'not worry about' can consume others. We have to be patient with those around us who we don't fully understand. I can't even express how much patience and compassion are necessary to help me through any struggle.</p>\n<p>On a positive note, we are just days away from finding out the gender! Will we need a pink or blue nursery??</p>"}}},{id:"GJIfENJHCUkEk28SW6s4w",title:"My Recent Lessons From God",createdAt:"February 20, 2018",featuredImage:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.5105740181268883,src:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&q=50",srcSet:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=200&h=132&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=400&h=265&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&h=530&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=1000&h=662&q=50 1000w",srcWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp",srcSetWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=200&h=132&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=400&h=265&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=800&h=530&q=50&fm=webp 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg?w=1000&h=662&q=50&fm=webp 1000w",sizes:"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"},id:"c2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4",file:{url:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/2lvJUxKqgwc6WEqqiG4AQ4/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/blogpost1.jpg",fileName:"blogpost1.jpg",contentType:"image/jpeg"}},content:{childMarkdownRemark:{html:"<p>I've gotten into a spiritual rut lately (I'm talking months and months here)- constantly praying to know God more, to feel his presence, to trust him more, to see his beauty around me.

Most days I don't 'feel' like it and honestly, I've had the thought \"if the Lord wants me to know him better, he will reveal himself to me.\"</p>\n<p>I recently went to my first women's retreat with church. I was hoping to learn something new and exciting but instead I was reminded of something I already knew but has completely pushed out of my mind: Those who seek the Lord find him when they seek him with all their hearts (Jeremiah 29:13).

This morning I had some free time before my day started. To read Harry Potter or not to read Harry Potter... then I saw my devotional book sitting on the shelf. I didn't really feel like reading something serious but I paused and had a thought: my emotions and feelings can be deceiving. Just because I don't feel like something doesn't mean it's not right.

Wow. <strong>In order to achieve oneness with him I have to make an effort, an actual effort.</strong> Moments of inspiration from the Lord are such a gift. This devotional says God will give us touches of his inspiration when we are not in danger of being led away by them. I really look forward to those moments when I can distinctly hear the voice of the Lord. They reassure my faith but they do not sustain it.</p>\n<p>I love my husband every day not just the moments when he sweeps me off my feet and takes my breath away. Those occasions are special and rare; and that's the way I want it.</p>\n<p>It's so hard to make time for something when we lack inspiration. I personally struggle with that. However, I still brush my teeth every day and do the dishes (not quite every day...). I just do it because it's the right thing to do. I brush my teeth because I want to care for my body and prevent future issues. I wash dishes because I like a clean home and don't want to smell the rot of old food.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we can view our spiritual lives that way. We need to get rid of the rot and the stink that sometimes fills up our lives and a great way to do that is by seeking the Lord. But really, truly, seeking him.</p>\n<p>I'm still working on this. Life can be so absolutely crazy I am thankful for the constant presence of God even when I lack motivation to seek him. That's how much he love us!</p>"}}},{id:"c44PSEridSw86qOy0aIQEWY",title:"Confessions of a Seeker of the Lord",createdAt:"February 20,

Some answers seem to change as I mature and expand my horizons. Some answers have not wavered although outside pressures direct me elsewhere.</p>\n<p>There are red-lettered answers in my Bible. As I read them I can picture Jesus standing in a crowd, teaching his followers with his dirty sandals and unkempt hair. He doesn't notice his appearance because he is more focused on the beggar at the street corner.</p>\n<p>I desperately want to be like that. I want to look past people's sexual orientations, political persuasions, past-lives, and addictions. I want to see their soul and meet them where they are like Jesus did.</p>\n<p>I was first introduced to Christianity at a Baptist church. Women were expected to wear skirts and not to say \"darn\" (too close to the real thing). That's all I knew; and I was taught the most important thing in life is everyone say the ABC prayer before they die.</p>\n<p>Accept Jesus. Believe he died for you. Confess your sins. BAM. Saved.</p>\n<p>I developed a fearful and judgmental attitude towards anyone whowas a \"non-Christian\".</p>\n<p>I am thankful for that experience because it's where I first stood in the presence of the Lord and that has changed my life. I am thankful to have an understanding of how many conservative Christians think. And I am also thankful to have grown out of that mindset, realizing knowing the Lord is an issue of the heart not a matter of aformula.</p>\n<p>But now, here I sit, a twenty-something Christian living in modern day America.

And that's okay.</p>\n<p>I have to admit, one of my guilty pleasures is starting debates with those who have very strong political persuasions. My goal is to convince my father I'm voting for Hilary Clinton. He might not be able to sleep at night, but it's too funny to resist.</p>\n<p>I'm left with questions: who would Jesus vote for? What would modern-day American Jesus do with his free time? How would he minister?</p>\n<p>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</p>\n<p>James 1:27</p>\n<p>I'm a seeker of the Lord who will keep on seekin'.</p>"}}},{id:"c3wzTVOZhfWSweeIIgAWMoW",title:"Save Your Venom",createdAt:"February 20, 2018",featuredImage:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1,src:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&q=50",srcSet:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w",srcWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp",srcSetWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w",sizes:"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"},id:"c1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU",file:{url:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1bKGZtk0e8SY2Ygyci4qkU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/happy-new-year.jpg",fileName:"happy-new-year.jpg",contentType:"image/jpeg"}},content:{childMarkdownRemark:{html:"<p>Since I got an iPhone last year, I've been pretty obsessed with podcasts. My current favorites are Serial and Heather Dubrow's World. I listen to them every week while I walk the dog, drive in the car, or go to the gym. Earlier this week I was listening once again as I happily worked out on the spin bike (okay fine, I was sweating profusely and constantly staring at the 30 minute timer willing it to end). Anyways, I heard a podcast with and the featured guest was <a href=\"http://kristiling.com/\">Kristi Ling</a>, the happiness strategist. I really don't like the word 'happy' because it's such a fluffy word. It just sounds so shallow to me.</p>\n<p>Everyone wants to be happy, find their happiness, find someone to make them happy.</p>\n<p>When I heard this lady who is an expert on happiness was coming on to the show I wasn't expecting much...honestly. However, she had great points and great ideas- I was so inspired I decided to write about it. I actually, perhaps, maybe, will consider buying her newest book.</p>\n<p>Kristi Ling wears a rattlesnake ring every day. Kind of a weird piece of jewelry if you ask me. For her, it's a daily reminder to 'save her venom'.</p>\n<p>Rattlesnakes have very poisonous venom. They need it to kill their prey so they can eat and survive. If approached by a threat, the snake will not strike. They wait until they are absolutely sure their very life is being threatened. Why? They need to save their venom! If they don't preserve their supply, they won't have it when they really need it. It's a waste.</p>\n<p>I LOVE THIS ANALOGY.</p>\n<p>I need to save my venom! It so perfectly relates to those struggling with anxiety. We get so anxious and freaked out by what-ifs all the time. Our fight or flight responses kick in and we go into hyper drive. For me, it doesn't matter if there is a real dangerous threat, my venom is ready to strike at any hint of fear.</p>\n<p>The other day I was driving in the car and started to become consumed with worry that my car would break down and I would have no way to get to work. I started thinking about how we would pay for repairs, could we afford a new car, would Jacob be able to drive me to work in the morning?</p>\n<p>Then I paused and remembered the rattlesnake. I want to be a rattlesnake. I want to save my venom.

Fear of death, fear of isolation, fear of no control, fear of the feeling lasting forever. Those are some of the things I've experienced. The most helpful 'tool in my toolbox' (a phrase my Grandmother uses) to help me through a panic attack is <strong>knowledge.</strong></p>\n<p>My first anxiety attack was by far the worst because I had no idea what was going on. I literally thought I was going crazy. Today through learning, reading, talking, sharing, I am able to successfully talk myself out of a full-blown panic attack on most occasions.</p>\n<p>It's uncomfortable for me to admit this but yes, I experienced an more-intense-than-usual anxiety attack a little while ago. I still struggle with this. They always sneak up out of nowhere, don't they?</p>\n<p>In the midst of the chaos, I realized I was talking to myself (in my head, don't worry). Once I came to this epiphany, that I did actually know what was going on with my body and why it was happening, I was so excited! How cool is it to learn new things about yourself?</p>\n<p>Everything seems less scary to me when I understand it. <strong>Knowledge is power.</strong></p>\n<p>After the event dissipated I immediately started writing my thought process down. I knew I had to share it and perhaps you'll be able to learn something new and become more successful at talking yourself through scary moments.</p>\n<p>Please observe,</p>\n<p><strong>How to talk yourself through a panic attack:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Understand what is going on with your body. When you experience a panic attack or feel that initial rush of adrenaline, your neurotransmitters in your brain are firing like crazy. Sometimes they don't calm down quite as they should, and your body thinks it's in immediate danger. Sometimes this happens out of nowhere, with no observable trigger. This is why it's called an \"attack\". Pause and realize what's going on. Talk to your neurotransmitters- become friends with them!</li>\n<li>Realizing you CAN still breathe. Take. Deep. Breaths.</li>\n<li>Nothing lasts forever. Even this unbearable feeling. You may have to repeat this out loud. \"I am okay, I am okay, I am okay.\"</li>\n<li>I'm not alone, you're not alone.</li>\n<li>Be kind to yourself. You are not weak, you are not lesser.</li>\n<li>Understand your triggers if they exist. Try to figure out what triggers your panic and think about why.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's no secret holidays cause stress. No matter how hard I try to remain calm, it has yet to happen. Between family tensions and holiday shopping, there is a lot of pressure.</p>\n<p>I might experience some panic, maybe you will too. With some practice we will be able to fight the anxiety and talk ourselves down and be able to spend more time reflecting on the reason for the season rather than in our own heads.</p>\n<p>Merry

can honestly say my marriage is my favorite part of life right now. Maybe one day it will be raising children, owning our own home, who knows what the future holds. Right now my happy place is in my husband's arms. In fact, it's been like that since the day we said \"I do\".</p>\n<p>After our wedding ceremony we walked down the aisle and turned the corner to a hallway in our church. There we stole our first moment alone as husband and wife. I remember feeling so thankful, so relieved, and so emotional I just wept into his embrace. It was a moment of pure joy.</p>\n<p>I get asked at work by students once in a while if I'm married. Always by some rowdy teenage boy (surprise).</p>\n<p>I say yes I am, and routinely point to my wedding ring. Funny how no one notices! Maybe it's a guy thing. Maybe I need a flashing one or something.</p>\n<p>Last week this happened again. After explaining the reason for the engagement ring and the wedding band- how they're different and which one you give first- one of the boys asked me if I loved my husband.</p>\n<p>I said yes, I do love him.</p>\n<p>No, do you really love him?</p>\n<p>I said yes, he's a great guy.</p>\n<p>Then he said do you really think you'll be together forever? Like honestly?</p>\n<p>First of all, I find it intriguing he wanted to know. I don't know his family history or if he comes from a broken home but I know he told me he never wants to get married.</p>\n<p>To answer his question, I paused. No one has ever asked me that before.</p>\n<p>I replied with a yes, I do believe that.</p>\n<p>He questioned my responsewith a squinting of his eyes and the cocking of his head.</p>\n<p>The divorce rate is astronomical. Who gets married and truly commits to be together 'til death due you part anymore? It's more like \"I commit to you until you stop fulfilling my needs or I simply change my mind.\" (I do understand the legitimate need for divorce, especially Biblical reasons such as adultery, etc) However; I hear of MANY couples splitting up over reasons that aren't found in the Bible. Christian and non-Christian couples alike. Life happens, I get it. We make mistakes and we make choices.</p>\n<p>I've been thinking about this conversation all week. Do I really believe we will be together forever? I'm terrified to commit to anything <strong>FOREVER.</strong></p>\n<p>What a scary word!</p>\n<p>What if he hurts my feelings? What if we lose the love and passion? What if I'm no longer physically attracted to him?</p>\n<p>The answer is I committed myself in front of God and my family. I stood up on a stage in front of my younger siblings, who I would do anything for, as they heard me make a promise. Probably the most serious promise I will ever make in my lifetime; to love and honor this man despite the ebbs and flows of life.</p>\n<p>We are \"young\", we are \"in love\", but we are also <strong>committed, loyal,</strong> and <strong>trusting</strong> in the Lord and his design for our marriage.</p>\n<p>I hesitate to share these thoughts with all of you because I know marriage and divorce are sensitive subjects for some. I sympathize with all the pain the loss of a marriage uncovers. I have seen it in my family and with my closest friends. Mourning the end of a marriage is like mourning the death of a loved one. Something living, breathing, and sacred dies and the loss is felt in a heavy way. The good news is God brings beauty into all darkness.</p>\n<p>If I could go back in time and compose a more thoughtful answer to this young man, I would say some of those things.</p>\n<p>I want him to know that marriage can be beautiful.

Everyone is after the hottest new trends and ways to look younger. Sex sells. Blah, blah, blah.</p>\n<p>I have been subconsciously buying into this deceit for my whole life.</p>\n<p>I remember in first grade my friend had a pair of jelly-shoes (remember those?!) and I was so jealous. I begged and begged until I finally got a pair. They still weren't as cool as her's... I even remember in first grade thinking I was chubby. Can you believe that! A six year old thinking she's chubby and comparing herself to other girls. Oh how I wish I knew the lies I was believing. I wish I could go back and hug my younger self and tell her how beautiful she was. I wonder if that would have changed how I think about myself now.</p>\n<p>Our culture sets women up for failure. We will never achieve the exact look we want. We will never have perfect outfits every day. We will have bad hair days. We will never be as toned, tight, or in shape as Jillian Michaels. Our culture wants to make sure we never 'arrive' there- what would society be able to sell us or convince us of if we were perfectly satisfied with who we are?</p>\n<p>I have spent more than fifteen years of my life thinking and worrying about my appearance. MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS. When I was laying in bed the other night reflecting on the meaning of life, which I do quite often, that thought popped into my head. That's a lot of thought energy wasted. I was lying there trying to figure out what to wear for work the next day. Like anyone actually cares what I wear... how silly... but I always try to look a little fashionable. I've wasted so much time and life thinking about those things.How much time have you used obsessing about your weight, clothing, new hair style?</p>\n<p>Be honest with yourself.</p>\n<p>Enough ladies. This needs to end.</p>\n<p>We were made for more!</p>\n<p>How can we help each other? How can we support one another to stop this cycle of belief? For myself, I will tell every six year old girl I see how beautiful they are. I will tell them how special God made them. I will tell them how everyone is different, and it's really exciting.

Not in a \"I'm confused about who I am\" sorta way. It just seems simpler. No monthly gift where your uterus tortures you for not being pregnant, no shaving your legs, no messing with your crazy bed-head for twenty minutes before work, no make up, blah blah blah. In my experience, men also have less anxiety overall and an easier time dealing with stress. Disclaimer: I realize this is a very over generalized statement, and some men do struggle with intense anxiety. Just not too many of the men I know.</p>\n<p>With the exception of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), women have twice the risk for most anxiety disorders as men.</p>\n<p>That's science. You can't argue with science. As a woman, I am at twice the risk for an anxiety disorder as any man. Lucky me! I won the anxiety disorder lottery. I sometimes ask my husband how he deals with stress. His usual response is, \"I just don't think about it. Then it goes away,\". Oh how I wonder what that would be like! It almost makes me angry with him. What do you mean you just don't think about it? Don't you worry about all the hundreds of things I worry about every day? How can you just fall fast asleep when you know there's three loads of laundry just waiting in the hamper and no groceries in the fridge?</p>\n<p>I have learned from him. It's like we were made for each other. We balance each other well- I thank the Lord every day for that.</p>\n<p>I am a woman, and I am learning to embrace everything that comes with that title. Emotions, hormones, anxiety, femininity. It's all beautiful.</p>\n<p>When my husband and I were dating we read two books called \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Women-Only-Revised-Updated-Edition/dp/1601424442/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_y\">For Women Only</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601424450/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=1944687682&#x26;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&#x26;pf_rd_t=201&#x26;pf_rd_i=1590523172&#x26;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&#x26;pf_rd_r=1STM30EC0D16PD0EDEW5\">For Men Only</a>\" by Shaunti Feldhahn and her husband Jeff Feldhahn. THESE BOOKS ARE AMAZING. We cannot stress that enough. It provides insight into the opposite gender's head you didn't even know existed. There are sections on love, intimacy, communication, and even stress. The area that talked about stress and worry was one of my favorites. I'm always looking for clear and concise ways to express to my husband how my mind works, and when I can find a professional clearly explain my thinking process, that's so incredibly helpful.</p>\n<p>Shaunti and Jeff describe women's minds by using the illustration of computer windows. Women have tons and tons of windows open. Each window represents a thought, worry, concern, etc. \"Women's thought lives are like busy computers with multiple windows open and all running at once,\".</p>\n<p>When a women in the book was asked, how do you operate with all those thoughts going on in your head at once? Why don't you just concentrate on one thing and turn all the other windows off?</p>\n<p>Her response, \"Because I can't. And even if I did, they'd come back,\".</p>\n<p>Can you ladies relate to that? I sure can. In a man's mind, they don't understand why we can't just close the windows. It's as simple as that, duh. Sorry guys... us women weren't wired that way. Women are shown to be unable to close their windows and \"<a href=\"http://abovethebattle.com/just-try-not-to-think-about-it/\">just not think about it</a>\"the way men can.</p>\n<p>In fact, in the \"For Women Only Book\", there isn't even a sectiondevoted to windows or worry thoughts. It doesn't exists because there are more important areas of a man's mind they focus on.</p>\n<p>I always tell my husband I don't expect him to understand everything about me, especially when it relates to anxiety. It does feel good when I come across someone, a blog, a book, that does seem to 'get it'. What I need from him is compassion. That's what I urge you to give to yourself and give to others you don't understand-regardless of their struggles.</p>\n<p>Spread the compassion!</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/anxiety-disorders#ixzz3eYoCCwnR\">Anxiety disorders</a> | <a href=\"http://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/anxiety-disorders#ixzz3eYoCCwnR\">University of Maryland Medical Center</a></p>"}}},{id:"c1nc38PWZHKqoEQImyc6GAS",title:"Exercise, Endorphins, & Anxiety",createdAt:"February 23, 2018",featuredImage:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,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",aspectRatio:2.5714285714285716,src:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/5juz3FBUmIi0CYQkqyyYGy/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/legallyblonde.png?w=800&q=50",srcSet:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/5juz3FBUmIi0CYQkqyyYGy/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/legallyblonde.png?w=200&h=78&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/5juz3FBUmIi0CYQkqyyYGy/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/legallyblonde.png?w=400&h=156&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/5juz3FBUmIi0CYQkqyyYGy/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/legallyblonde.png?w=630&h=245&q=50 630w",srcWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/5juz3FBUmIi0CYQkqyyYGy/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/legallyblonde.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp",srcSetWebp:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/5juz3FBUmIi0CYQkqyyYGy/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/legallyblonde.png?w=200&h=78&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/5juz3FBUmIi0CYQkqyyYGy/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/legallyblonde.png?w=400&h=156&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/5juz3FBUmIi0CYQkqyyYGy/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/legallyblonde.png?w=630&h=245&q=50&fm=webp 630w",sizes:"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"},id:"c5juz3FBUmIi0CYQkqyyYGy",file:{url:"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/5juz3FBUmIi0CYQkqyyYGy/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/legallyblonde.png",fileName:"legallyblonde.png",contentType:"image/png"}},content:{childMarkdownRemark:{html:"<p>\"Exercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just dont shoot their husbands, they just dont.\"</p>\n<p>Anyone?</p>\n<p>Every time I go to the gym and leave feeling awesome, I say this quote to myself in my head. It's not on purpose, it's like an involuntary thing that I'm slightly embarrassed about.</p>\n<p>I am a woman; therefore, like most women, I have body insecurities. I've had these insecurities since I was six or seven. I can remember being in first grade and not liking things about myself- how sad! Everything amplified in middle school and then high school. My friends and I basically thought it was cool to skip lunch. Eating anything meant we were just consuming too many calories. Totally logical, right?</p>\n<p>Today I can honestly say I love myself. Do I love everything about my body? Nope. I wish I did. It doesn't matter how many times my husband tells me I'm beautiful, sexy, perfect. I'm not satisfied.</p>\n<p>After graduating college and getting married I gained some weight. Seventeen pounds to be exact. But who's counting...? I was shocked, angry, mortified, disgusted with myself when the doctor told me the news. How can this little number have so much power over my life? Over our lives?</p>\n<p>That was around two months ago. Since that day I have been faithfully going to the gym. I've lost a little weight, but that doesn't really matter as much to me now. I feel amazing. Exercise helps me feel great about myself no matter what the scale says. It also helps with my stress and anxiety levels tremendously. I do some of my finer thinking while I'm plowing around the indoor track.</p>\n<p>Two years ago my doctor told me the solution to an anxiety disorder was exercise. She said if I like to run a mile, now it's time for me to run five. I didn't fully embrace her advice. I stuck to my yoga class routine, not noticing much difference. It has taken me almost two years to realize the necessity of hot and sweaty exercise in my life. (disclaimer- I do not, and cannot, run five miles).</p>\n<p>Maybe you remember a little bit about hormones and how they basically run your body. Maybe not. When you exercise your body releases chemicals called endorphins. Endorphins are known as the 'feel good hormone'. They trigger a positive feeling in the body and reduce the reception of pain. They are known to decrease the feelings of anxiety and depression. And let me tell you, it works.</p>\n<p>When I was in the midst of feeling awful, I went for two or three walks every day. It's the only thing that provided me relief.</p>\n<p>When you are depressed or anxious the last thing you want to do is put on a sports bra and go for a run. If you can get yourself dressed, you are half way there. You won't regret it afterwards.</p>\n<p>For more scientific information about endorphins and the powerful role they play in your body, check out this article here.</p>\n<p>I would love to, and probably will, share more about body insecurities and weight issues. But not today.</p>\n<p>I want to share what I know works.</p>\n<p>Exercise works.</p>\n<p>Next time you're feeling especially anxious go to the gym, go for a walk. Do something. Nothing we do has to be perfect. All we have to do is try our best, and let God fill in the gaps.</p>"}}}]}},pathContext:{category:"Women's Issues"}}}});
