due date was Monday, November fourteenth. I woke up and went to work just like any other day- except this day I was hoping to not return home. I had hopes for a natural birth. The doctors told me I was young and healthy, this was going to be great. I kept telling my coworkers I thought my water was going to break; a woman just knows when somethings not 'normal' down there. Late into the night I got into bed and felt a warm gush... just like the doctor said I would. Then we were off! I was so incredibly excited yet calm. We texted, called, and emailed family and coworkers. Life was about to change and I just had no idea what to expect.</p>\\n<p>We parked in the parking garage and I felt a sense of pride that I could still walk around, although I was definitely leaving a mess behind. My husband made me ride in a wheelchair, which was probably the best idea. He's good at being kind to me.</p>\\n<p>The hospital was eerily quiet, but it was two in the morning. No contractions started so the doctors had me pacing the hallways in my fancy hospital socks. One hour, two hours, nothing. And then came my first unexpected blow: we need to induce you. Sorry, you're not progressing.</p>\\n<p>Five hours later and still less than halfway dilated. My heart dropped to the floor when the doctor (the first of three) told me this was going to be an evening baby and the sun had barely just risen. I had no energy left at this point. Then came unexpected blow number two: I asked for the epidural.</p>\\n<p>Time passed in a haze as I lay in the hospital bed, contracting but barely feeling anything but a heaviness, listening to a repeating soundtrack my husband put on as a distraction. People kept bringing him food; I was beyond envious he didn't have to live through the day like I did.</p>\\n<p>Late into the evening there was a doctor, a nurse, two nurse interns, and my husband all in the room when my doctor said the biggest unexpected blow number three: you might want to consider a c-section at this point. Baby is not dropping and you seem to not be dilated beyond eight centimeters. That's when the tears came. And the vomit. Did I mention all the vomit? They said it was the medication, lack of food, hormones... either way it sucked. I was so desperate for relief and afraid the baby would never come so I said yes. And I don't regret my decision, I just feel sad for the way I experienced it.</p>\\n<p>I remember telling Jacob in the hospital that I was never having another baby. We were adopting. That is that. Everyone said I would change my mind... but I think i'm still working through the trauma of it all. We want Eli to have a sibling: to learn how to share and live in community. I just don't know if I can handle that experience again. When you battle anxiety and depression, mixed with wacky hormones, throw in an unexpected emergency surgery, oh and a real life baby: you get fear. I have lived with fear since the moment he was born. Please don't misunderstand, I have joy. I love that child more than I love myself. But there is a degree of fear underlying my thoughts I can't quite put my finger on.</p>\\n<p>Today and every day I try to live in the present. I try to hold him and rock him to sleep and not to rush this time of life together. I pray, I ask for guidance, call the doctor all the time, and try not to take myself too seriously.</p>\\n<p>We sure did get lucky with a baby who still smiles at me even though he can't breathe out of his nose right now. My grandma told me he was going to bring a lot of joy into our lives and she was correct. Despite my fear, despite my uncertainty, he is teaching me to just sit there and giggle with him.</p>\\n<p>Welcome to this crazy world Eli William!</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"tOQlNA9lyoskcoUgqMEqm\",\"title\":\"Between Life & Death\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAUCAIAAAAC64paAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAB3RJTUUH4gIXAhQDlHV+7gAAA7tJREFUOMslVFlv20YYJLnLUxRJxZUb2zpswTF8RoVrN0CBwE91UCD9kQ3QP9K0fk0cR7Ud1JdEiZJNSdbFY3l1pPJFS+3s7HzfN0P+jw+/K7IsEJKlaRCGkijyPC8IAouiOI5zmhZFkSiKM8+jhMiynKQpkIxFsiwJei43h4Ys4zhAgcuyLAyZqijYwklCSBiGlmniJBbYBd40DeDpx7MznKGUchwHUvDhvCDMhXA8BxVpmgLt+360EMIYgyLP92VJppdX15Zl4bCiKJqmgV5YPFzGZVkKRtyMV1AEQTAcPidJgsvTNEGNtFQqn777JYli03qhqPJkPFqvVqdTP07TSqWEOpMkfuo9tZ1erbbO85zve61ms+8OnK5DQQmdlmlNxhPTMj9+/vPi4kKiYvfRffPmp8fH3u7u7udPn+7u7lmc/nhYX15e3j/Yt5utKI4oNHieN+j3NUX9cn5++u5UpLTdtsvlMvp9fHxsGPmVlV/7rtt8sB/s9snJie8HhaWlkDGyu7e/ubkJbWiPY7dvbu/H4zFa0u12R6PRP5fXw+EgCHy73TYNA1WcXzSKxaUoYrc3N2R7e3t1bQ1dWV1bdV1XliRRVtAr07Jkifqen3HovVCtVDDqYvE7CLy5vaOoq9tFzUnoB47Twf0Hrw9mk6ltO8WX3xcKZl7XDcMYj6ej50mpxL9cWdE01TTNOGI9x8E0yM7OTsE0Qhbl83qz2VRUBUSNr43pdMZYOIToQT+Xy3k+A5GmqlAGzGw6cftD8kO9XtuoOk53rVQG69bWKwxcItAlWlZBz+cr1QrPZQ93d9/+vQXjcrEYJwl2nY5D6vX627c/263WoD+4vW/ChmiyKItPj73rq28CRY+Irusg7Nh2u2XPvEAUJbSw0+mQvd09zINFTM9pdssWCIVSuLJcKTUaDSpQFsU5Pbe+XqtWy4gQfDEaT/76+wzGIxu1jeOjo3bHWS2tckkShYzjqazItVrtdf0AjE+9R44neSMvy4r1okAEfth3x8MB4kXQZMwT2hDE4fPgHrVdXzcurzDt2cwbPj8DPR4M2p0uW2QTRamaahi66/b5396/h/thfWRjngcEDQtCsID9Eclk8eAVfYqjCI6cZ2OeG44eHR5SkcJxqEGSJFQL7iRNkDhwIQlBEAKtKPL/OYf5gEFyAaNbrzbx4UD0F3thmmUwGf7BtXidj4xSoOHkdE6hAABKP8BlhMIA+JlMpwCpqorJIKiBH8BMucVHBjGGYLgN9+NadDvjeEwU6/8AD3Y/ubKiH4EAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png\",\"fileName\":\"052819-1.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>I'm sitting here on my balcony looking at the last little triangle of sunlight shining on a tree as it sets behind us.

Grandma is dying.</p>\\n<p>It's hard to live life when there's so much good and so much bad.</p>\\n<p>Living between anticipated new life and anticipated death is a weird space. And both are completely new to me. That's scary. I have no idea what it's like to give birth or to be a mother; and I have no idea what it's like to lose someone I truly love with all my soul. Yet both are inevitably going to happen, and sooner than I feel ready for.</p>\\n<p>Tears burn my eyes. My throat feels like it's closing in as I try to not let emotion overcome me. The sadness and the fear are so strong in these moments.</p>\\n<p>I take a few minutes to check social media because I'm not sure what I'm trying to say or where my thoughts are headed. All I know is that I'm caught in a gray area- dark gray. That means it's time to pray.</p>\\n<p>There are five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. I keep wondering if I'm in this cycle. Is there a stage called confusion? That seems more accurate. All those other feelings come and go. Who invented this formula for grief? How can anyone decide who experiences what? Maybe some people can't get past the depression; that is frightening. Maybe some people slip right into acceptance because their faith is so strong they know who is in control. I want that. I want so much trust in the Lord nothing so \\\"normal\\\" as life and death could shake me.</p>\\n<p>Alas, I am reminded of my humanness.

No line, no change in color, so I set it on the counter and started to brush my teeth. Didn't want to be late for work. I happened to glance back down at it before throwing it in the trash and I saw the beginning of a pink streak.</p>\\n<p>OH MY GOSH. (those weren't the exact words that came out...)</p>\\n<p>If my years working at a pregnancy center taught me anything it was that any pink line meant something was going on. This was real.</p>\\n<p>I always had the vision I would find out I was pregnant, keep it from my husband until I could come up with some cute little baby surprise and wow him. Well, none of that happens in real life.</p>\\n<p>I instantly woke him up, tried to get words out through my hyper breathing, and told him what the test said. He replied with a slobbery lisp through his nighttime mouth guard, \\\"Are you serious?\\\".</p>\\n<p>Pure romance.</p>\\n<p>I was told about three years ago from a doctor, \\\"Once you get pregnant, your anxiety will significantly improve. You will probably not need any medication and in fact, your hormone levels might stabilize and you'll never need medication again.\\\" That is not a direct quote but rather the gist of the conversation. I was skeptical of this projection; but really hoping and praying those words were true.</p>\\n<p>For me, they weren't.</p>\\n<p>In fact, my anxiety became unmanageable after my doctor told me to quickly ween of all medication and just suck it up. Maybe the pregnancy would give me more 'motivation'. Needless to say I was terrified, angry, and desperate for relief and peace.</p>\\n<p>All I could think about was how in the world was I suppose to be a mother when I could barely find the motivation to get through the day, let alone smile.</p>\\n<p>Since then I have sought the opinion of three other doctors (one of them being a highly-qualified specialist in maternal infant health psychiatry). I am back on a steady dose of medication, saw my therapist for a couple months, and feeling overall huge improvements.</p>\\n<p>I lost myself for a month. I was unable to enjoy and fully celebrate the fact I was creating life inside me because the worry, anxiety, and depression completely took over. If you are ever in a similar situation; seek multiple opinions. Ultimately you will know what's best. Most often the best decision is the one where you feel whole and complete. That's what my child needs; a mother who can be present, whole, complete, and peaceful.</p>\\n<p>Since finding out we were going to have a baby, life has gotten crazy. We realized we needed to move... a tiny 400 square-foot apartment with a baby and a black lab just wasn't how I wanted to spend my time. Thus began the searching and moving process.</p>\\n<p>Almost four months into my pregnancy I was driving home from work and was hit by a man trying to cross five lanes of traffic, right into the drivers side. That resulted in a multitude of medical tests and tears, all of which came back fine. We are praising the Lord for that!</p>\\n<p>Then my husband found out some not-so-encouraging medical news, which has completely upped my stress level.</p>\\n<p>Then our doggie hurt his paw and had to go to the emergency vet and wear the cone of shame for a whole week. He was even on dog narcotics! It was sad but almost comical to watch.</p>\\n<p>Then we bought our new car and it's already in the shop. We've owned it for four days.</p>\\n<p>I forgot to mention in the midst of all this I started a new job and Jacob is having trouble at his work. When my husband, who is always the calm one, is constantly stressed it really throws us for a loop.</p>\\n<p>My beloved grandmother is going through a possible cancer-scare, which has our whole family in tense waiting.</p>\\n<p>We are moving to a completely new city in a month and a half.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say I am so thankful for the medication I am able to take to help me cope with life lately. I am even more thankful for the Lord's constant provision and peace. <a href=\\\"https://bible.org/seriespage/60-compound-names-jehovah-jireh-rapha-nissi\\\">Jehovah-jireh</a>, the Lord provides. My favorite saying and my favorite truth to live day by day.</p>\\n<p>\\\"The Revelation of the Name <strong>Jehovah-Jireh</strong>, Genesis 22:12-14. The meaning of this name is The Lord Who Provides. The name is literally, The Lord Who Sees, or The Lord Who Will See To It. This is what we long for when we have a need that is personal and special; One who will see to our needs and provide for us. This is what Jehovah-Jireh means; the Lord Who will see to it that my every need is met. One Who knows my need because He sees.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Regular life stress can be really difficult for someone dealing with an anxiety disorder.

She had a really positive experience with her medication and felt like a new woman; restored to her old self and possibly even feeling better than ever. Recently some old symptoms crept back up and she contacted me. She thought she was cured. I also wanted to be 'cured'. But there is no such thing from my experience.

Do we really want to be cured? Sometimes we wish we could forget it all. But our struggles make us who we are and we are stronger because of them.

My current favorites are Serial and Heather Dubrow's World. I listen to them every week while I walk the dog, drive in the car, or go to the gym. Earlier this week I was listening once again as I happily worked out on the spin bike (okay fine, I was sweating profusely and constantly staring at the 30 minute timer willing it to end). Anyways, I heard a podcast with and the featured guest was <a href=\\\"http://kristiling.com/\\\">Kristi Ling</a>, the happiness strategist. I really don't like the word 'happy' because it's such a fluffy word. It just sounds so shallow to me.</p>\\n<p>Everyone wants to be happy, find their happiness, find someone to make them happy.</p>\\n<p>When I heard this lady who is an expert on happiness was coming on to the show I wasn't expecting much...honestly. However, she had great points and great ideas- I was so inspired I decided to write about it. I actually, perhaps, maybe, will consider buying her newest book.</p>\\n<p>Kristi Ling wears a rattlesnake ring every day. Kind of a weird piece of jewelry if you ask me. For her, it's a daily reminder to 'save her venom'.</p>\\n<p>Rattlesnakes have very poisonous venom. They need it to kill their prey so they can eat and survive. If approached by a threat, the snake will not strike. They wait until they are absolutely sure their very life is being threatened. Why? They need to save their venom! If they don't preserve their supply, they won't have it when they really need it. It's a waste.</p>\\n<p>I LOVE THIS ANALOGY.</p>\\n<p>I need to save my venom! It so perfectly relates to those struggling with anxiety. We get so anxious and freaked out by what-ifs all the time. Our fight or flight responses kick in and we go into hyper drive. For me, it doesn't matter if there is a real dangerous threat, my venom is ready to strike at any hint of fear.</p>\\n<p>The other day I was driving in the car and started to become consumed with worry that my car would break down and I would have no way to get to work. I started thinking about how we would pay for repairs, could we afford a new car, would Jacob be able to drive me to work in the morning?</p>\\n<p>Then I paused and remembered the rattlesnake. I want to be a rattlesnake. I want to save my venom. And that's exactly what happened.</p>\\n<p>I realized how much I was panicking about something that wasn't happening. <strong>I was wasting my time and thought energy on a hypothetical situation when the reality was everything was fine.</strong></p>\\n<p>I love this analogy so much I considered getting my own rattlesnake ring as a reminder. Then I thought about it some more... and realized I would never actually wear that. But it's a great idea for those who love reptiles or animal-themed accessories!</p>\\n<p>Listening to Kristi's interview inspired me to think more about the things that bring me joy in my daily life and how I can be more intentional with making them a part of my routine.</p>\\n<h4>I want to seek joy and save my venom.</h4>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c13g0KKtV9iUAgKssgWi6Qu\",\"title\":\"Talking Yourself Through a Panic Attack\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1xMN66GjtKw6EOIuKegUKk/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Just-breathe.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1xMN66GjtKw6EOIuKegUKk/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Just-breathe.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1xMN66GjtKw6EOIuKegUKk/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Just-breathe.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1xMN66GjtKw6EOIuKegUKk/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Just-breathe.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1xMN66GjtKw6EOIuKegUKk/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Just-breathe.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1xMN66GjtKw6EOIuKegUKk/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Just-breathe.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1xMN66GjtKw6EOIuKegUKk/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Just-breathe.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1xMN66GjtKw6EOIuKegUKk/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Just-breathe.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c1xMN66GjtKw6EOIuKegUKk\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1xMN66GjtKw6EOIuKegUKk/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Just-breathe.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"Just-breathe.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>When we experience panic or anxiety attacks, the biggest response is usually fear. Fear of death, fear of isolation, fear of no control, fear of the feeling lasting forever. Those are some of the things I've experienced. The most helpful 'tool in my toolbox' (a phrase my Grandmother uses) to help me through a panic attack is <strong>knowledge.</strong></p>\\n<p>My first anxiety attack was by far the worst because I had no idea what was going on. I literally thought I was going crazy. Today through learning, reading, talking, sharing, I am able to successfully talk myself out of a full-blown panic attack on most occasions.</p>\\n<p>It's uncomfortable for me to admit this but yes, I experienced an more-intense-than-usual anxiety attack a little while ago. I still struggle with this. They always sneak up out of nowhere, don't they?</p>\\n<p>In the midst of the chaos, I realized I was talking to myself (in my head, don't worry). Once I came to this epiphany, that I did actually know what was going on with my body and why it was happening, I was so excited! How cool is it to learn new things about yourself?</p>\\n<p>Everything seems less scary to me when I understand it. <strong>Knowledge is power.</strong></p>\\n<p>After the event dissipated I immediately started writing my thought process down. I knew I had to share it and perhaps you'll be able to learn something new and become more successful at talking yourself through scary moments.</p>\\n<p>Please observe,</p>\\n<p><strong>How to talk yourself through a panic attack:</strong></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Understand what is going on with your body. When you experience a panic attack or feel that initial rush of adrenaline, your neurotransmitters in your brain are firing like crazy. Sometimes they don't calm down quite as they should, and your body thinks it's in immediate danger. Sometimes this happens out of nowhere, with no observable trigger. This is why it's called an \\\"attack\\\". Pause and realize what's going on. Talk to your neurotransmitters- become friends with them!</li>\\n<li>Realizing you CAN still breathe. Take. Deep. Breaths.</li>\\n<li>Nothing lasts forever. Even this unbearable feeling. You may have to repeat this out loud. \\\"I am okay, I am okay, I am okay.\\\"</li>\\n<li>I'm not alone, you're not alone.</li>\\n<li>Be kind to yourself. You are not weak, you are not lesser.</li>\\n<li>Understand your triggers if they exist. Try to figure out what triggers your panic and think about why.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>It's no secret holidays cause stress. No matter how hard I try to remain calm, it has yet to happen. Between family tensions and holiday shopping, there is a lot of pressure.</p>\\n<p>I might experience some panic, maybe you will too.

haven't written anything in a couple months because I've been tired, stressed, busy, a combination of all those things. Just dealing with life. And a new dog (he is super cute). And a new school year. And laundry.</p>\\n<p>I sometimes forget or neglect to sit down and think about things when I get so wrapped up in life. That's exactly what I needed to do: write, reflect, breathe, share.</p>\\n<p>I'm slightly mad at myself for putting these things off for the past two months but Jesus gets it. He understands. He was there.</p>\\n<p>I've been (very slowly) reading my way through a <a href=\\\"http://sheilawalsh.com/\\\">Sheila Walsh</a> book titled \\\"God Loves Broken People (And Those Who Pretend They're Not)\\\". Every page is juicy and makes me want to share it. I have little bookmarks and folded corners all over the book. Sheila admits she's broken and helps us see that we are too. She strongly emphasizes how the darkness in our souls can open us to the intimacy and love of Jesus we might not have known otherwise. Jesus suffered, he shares in our suffering.</p>\\n<p>\\\"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled,\\\" John 11:33</p>\\n<p>Sheila explains the word 'moved' here is translated from the Greek word 'embrimaomai'. That word is strong and represents anger, strength, or the bellowing and snorting of a horse. Some might say fury. Christ was feeling fury at the pain Mary and Martha were feeling in this situation. She points out that Christ rages with us.</p>\\n<p>How differently would we experience pain if we truly understood that Jesus feels with us?</p>\\n<p>I've been trying to reflect on that over the weekend. I was feeling anxious: Jesus gets it. I was frustrated: Jesus gets it. Jesus was the master of <a href=\\\"http://abovethebattle.com/the-beginning/\\\">rising above the battle.</a></p>\\n<p>God never promised us an easy journey but He did promise us He wins in the end (John 16:33).</p>\\n<p>When we're feeling lost, depressed, anxious, terrified, angry... let's take a moment to remember Jesus gets it.

I know my last post said 'you're having a bad day, you don't have a bad life'. I believe that's true but what do we do when we don't feel like that? What do we do when we feel like we have the worst life ever? What do we do when the weight of the world is pressing so heavily on our shoulders it's almost hard to breathe? How about when we truly, to the depths of our souls, can't get out of the pit that depression or anxiety is holding us under?</p>\\n<p>I don't know.</p>\\n<p>If I did, I wouldn't still deal with some of those feelings. No one would. The truth is many people deal with these issues and you're not alone.</p>\\n<p>The truth is there is never a \\\"quick fix\\\". Quick fixes don't exist- but healing does.</p>\\n<p>The answer is to keep going. Every minute is an accomplishment. I remember when I was feeling my worst a couple years ago I took a long drive. I was meeting with a Pastor to talk about my life and the desperation I was going through. On the way home from the meeting I started singing. Like to myself, in the car, just for fun. That was the first time I had sang anything or even wanted to attempt to make any joyful noise come out of my mouth in a long time. Just for a moment I had a glimpse of what it would feel like to be \\\"normal\\\" again. <a href=\\\"http://abovethebattle.com/a-letter-to-the-lost/\\\">It gave me hope.</a></p>\\n<p>Seek those moments. Seek the moments where your heart can be a little lighter and you can breathe a little easier.

And I repeat it to myself every now and again.When we are in the midst of a rough time it's easy to lose perspective.</p>\\n<p>Ever heard of hashtag firstworldproblems? The problems we face seem really strange to those in other countries who don't have any clean water to drink or who are dying because they don't have access to basic antibiotics. The funny thing is, we know this!</p>\\n<p>Ex: My cookie dough ice cream doesn't have enough cookie dough. #firstworldproblems</p>\\n<p>(I actually found this quote on <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/Ashley_Manzo\\\">Twitter</a>, fyi)</p>\\n<p>I know we all have heard about poverty and world hunger. Those numbers are easy to hear and easy to forget. Let me give you a little refresher for a clear perspective.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>According to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty.</li>\\n<li>Preventable diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia take the lives of 2 million children a year.</li>\\n<li>1/4 of all humans live without electricity approximately 1.6 billion people.</li>\\n<li>For more stats <a href=\\\"https://www.dosomething.org/facts/11-facts-about-global-poverty\\\">click here.</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This computer we are on and the cell phone you just used is a luxury. 1.6 billion people in this world don't even have access to electricity. And we have other luxuries like toilets and air conditioning. I don't know what I would do without those last two!</p>\\n<p>I know when I'm facing a hard time or in the midst of an internal crisis, nothing you could say to me would make much of a difference. I don't have the mental capacity to step outside of myself and view this life through a healthy perspective. I'm not minimizing our first world problems; to us, they really are struggles. Anxiety and depression are a HUGE issue in the United States. People who have never faced hunger face these things on a daily basis. I think by staying present and being in a constant state of realizing how blessed we are, we can be more equipped to keep our life in perspective when a breakdown occurs.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes I feel like if we've never been taught how to look outside ourselves or never experienced other cultures, we don't know how to see anything but our own wants and needs.</p>\\n<p>Working with young teenagers is a great way to see up close and personal how egocentric our culture is. They don't realize it and it's definitely a part of the maturing process, but I find it funny. Was I the same way at fourteen? Did my life crumble around me if my cell phone broke or someone said something to me the wrong way? Maybe.</p>\\n<p>Our culture is all about \\\"me\\\". It's about how \\\"I\\\" feel, what \\\"I\\\" want, if \\\"I'm\\\" offended... I remember my mother having a shirt that said \\\"I Heart Me\\\" on it. How strange is that? Most of us don't walk around displaying our self-centeredness but our thoughts and actions do it for us.</p>\\n<p>YOU might be having a bad day, but that doesn't mean YOU have a bad life. Let's be open to keeping a clear perspective. I challenge myself and I challenge you to take a step outside yourself and be thankful. The next time you're having a bad day, take a moment to remember you don't have a bad life.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c1c5S1Vo0io640iYGWwYugU\",\"title\":\"The Day My Life Changed\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png\",\"fileName\":\"Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>July 7th, 2013. Just an ordinary day. If I remember correctly, it was extremely hot. We were in the middle of a summer scorcher. I woke up, refused to get out of bed for the usual 7am Wednesday morning yoga class. Snoozed my alarm for almost 2 hours. Ate some toast. Then went to work.</p>\\n<p>I was a waitress at the time. Being a waitress is a great job; and it's a horrible job. You see the best of humanity - happy families on vacation, birthday celebrations, couples celebrating 50 years of marriage. Then, you see the worse of humanity - hot tourists who are so 'hangry' you can never bring the food fast enough, people who complain about the prices even though it was free-will to dine at that restaurant, toddlers who can't seem to get it together, and servers when they are pissed off at the world.</p>\\n<p>There are a certain type of people who work at restaurants. Some even make a career out of it. Know what I'm talking about? I've worked in a couple different places, and most of the employees have similar traits. I never quite fit in. I don't swear, I don't sleep with coworkers, I don't have nipple piercings (that was a real thing I encountered), and I don't go to strip clubs.</p>\\n<p>On July 7th, 2013 my coworkers were talking about their latest endeavor. They were planning on 'initiating' an 18 year old bus boy into adulthood by taking him to a 'refined' strip club. They asked me, sorta halfheartedly if I would like to join them. I said no. And for once I stood up for myself and I told them why. Always, I stay quiet. I was the 'good girl'. I never joined in on the party but I never stopped it either. So this time I shared my opinion and that was the last moment I ever felt \\\"normal\\\".</p>\\n<p>I told them how I believe the sex industry is out-of-control. I don't remember the exact words I used but I know I talked about human trafficking and how it's a REAL ISSUE in the United States. And I said that by going to a strip club, I would feel like I was participating in that and contributing money. No can do.</p>\\n<p>Nobody wants to think about morals when it comes to having a good time. Nobody likes the party crasher who is over-religious and making people feel bad for a decision that I believe deep down inside, they agreed with. Those were the thoughts going through my head at the time. At least something like that because all I remember after that is sitting down on the floor right where I stood because I swore I was going to pass out.</p>\\n<p>I was so hot. My hands were shaking. I was light headed. I thought I was having some sort of allergic reaction to a muffin I just ate. I asked my coworkers for some Benadryl, no luck. They got me orange juice- said I must have low blood sugar. That was a possibility, I suppose.</p>\\n<p>I stood up and moved from the floor to a chair. Then the tears came streaming down. Endless tears. It's like I had no control of my body. I remember feeling intense fear, I had no idea what was going on with me. Was I going to pass out? Was I dying? I felt like I was short of breath. My throat had to be closing in on itself because my inhales weren't quite what they should be.</p>\\n<p>No body knew how to respond so they called security. A man picked me up and drove me to the closest urgent care in town. On the way there he asked, \\\"You aren't going to pass out on me or anything are you?\\\" Umm, I don't freakin' know. Aren't you prepared for this type of thing?</p>\\n<p>After waiting for what seemed like forever at the urgent care and being hit on by the creepy doctor, he diagnosed me with low blood sugar. Then proceeded to tell me how I was destined to be a nurse so I didn't have to 'rely on any man'.</p>\\n<p>Urgent care took me back to work, I drove home in a daze, andunknowingly set out on a journey that would produce countless sleepless nights, panic attacks, and fear. Just a lot of fear.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say, July 7th is a big anniversary for me. Not the kind with chocolates and flowers (although that's not a bad idea Jacob...); but it's a reminder for me of where I am and where I came from. It's a reminder that I am a fragile human being whose only true source of strength is from the Lord. It's a reminder that I need to take care of myself and take my feelings seriously.</p>\\n<p>We all have those days in our lives that we can remember so vividly. If you asked me to tell you what I did on July 6th, couldn't tell you. But the 7th, I even remember exactly what I was wearing.</p>\\n<p>Painful experiences stick with us but eventually they don't sting as much and we are able to reflect and learn.</p>\\n<p>I spoke with a Pastor friend and he encouraged me to read the book of Philippians. I would repeat this verse over and over again in my mind until I could sleep. One night I think it was close to three hours of repetition.</p>\\n<p>Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</p>\\n<p>Philippians 4:6-7</p>\\n<p>Thanks for reading,</p>\\n<p>Ashley</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c6hDsNJTy0wMKcaQw4Uk4oe\",\"title\":\"Poetry\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.500952380952381,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=400&h=266&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=788&h=525&q=50 788w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=200&h=133&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=400&h=266&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=788&h=525&q=50&fm=webp 788w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png\",\"fileName\":\"poetry.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>My husband and I are youth leaders at our church.

Because yes, they have the right number, but you're not the person they're looking for, not anymore.</p>\\n<p>-C.</p>\\n<p>She was lost and broken inside.</p>\\n<p>No one to run to and no where to hide.</p>\\n<p>Someone came along and broke her down, she felt like she was going to drown.</p>\\n<p>Now she's completely done.</p>\\n<p>All she wanted to do was run.</p>\\n<p>Broken home, broken family, all she wanted to do was grow up happily.</p>\\n<p>Chased after a guy, and all he said was lies.</p>\\n<p>Now she has a broken heart, and soon to find someone to turn it into a work of art.</p>\\n<p>All tangled up in depression, and all she needs is another session.</p>\\n<p>Too much emotional pain is making her insane.</p>\\n<p>Prays every night and just wants to take flight into the brightest light.</p>\\n<p>Met a guy over the summer, then had to leave, what a bummer.</p>\\n<p>At her apartment, has too much to drink and needs to think.</p>\\n<p>Collapses to the floor, all of a sudden he busts open the door.</p>\\n<p>Laying in a hospital bed, he thought she was dead.</p>\\n<p>She sees him sitting in the chair, and thought he would never care.</p>\\n<p>He gets up, kisses her forehead, and whispers don't go back to bed.</p>\\n<p>-S.</p>\\n<p>On a side note, I love poetry. I'm not an avid writer or reader, but I often get sucked in. It amazes me how a specific compilation of words can produce such emotion. I know many people who use poetry or spoken word to get things off their chest and to express themselves. Anyone want to share some more with me?</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c3OPmn3GehimwAaAo2OMcyA\",\"title\":\"Daily Survival Tips for Those Dealing with Depression & Anxiety\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/COYZD5j8nQaWySqwwWSSQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/WE-DO-THE-FOOTWORK-AND-LET-GOD-DO-THE.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/COYZD5j8nQaWySqwwWSSQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/WE-DO-THE-FOOTWORK-AND-LET-GOD-DO-THE.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/COYZD5j8nQaWySqwwWSSQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/WE-DO-THE-FOOTWORK-AND-LET-GOD-DO-THE.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/COYZD5j8nQaWySqwwWSSQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/WE-DO-THE-FOOTWORK-AND-LET-GOD-DO-THE.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/COYZD5j8nQaWySqwwWSSQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/WE-DO-THE-FOOTWORK-AND-LET-GOD-DO-THE.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/COYZD5j8nQaWySqwwWSSQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/WE-DO-THE-FOOTWORK-AND-LET-GOD-DO-THE.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/COYZD5j8nQaWySqwwWSSQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/WE-DO-THE-FOOTWORK-AND-LET-GOD-DO-THE.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/COYZD5j8nQaWySqwwWSSQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/WE-DO-THE-FOOTWORK-AND-LET-GOD-DO-THE.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"COYZD5j8nQaWySqwwWSSQ\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/COYZD5j8nQaWySqwwWSSQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/WE-DO-THE-FOOTWORK-AND-LET-GOD-DO-THE.png\",\"fileName\":\"WE-DO-THE-FOOTWORK-AND-LET-GOD-DO-THE.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Often I find myself in this destructive cycle: I have stress, I worry about my stress, I do MORE to \\\"combat\\\" my stress, that produces more stress, then I worry about my stress... you get the picture. When I feel anxiety and stress I blame myself and assume I'm not doing \\\"enough\\\" self-care. It must be my fault. Here I am, failing at life yet again.</p>\\n<p>Am I alone in this?</p>\\n<p>Thankfully, the logical side of my brain helps me realize this is idiotic. Worrying about my stress and pushing myself to do more to combat stress only produces more stress! It's so silly. When I talk about it out loud to my therapist or to a friend, I realize how crazy I sound. And actually, I have a lot of self-care routines I practice daily. They are embedded in my lifestyle now and I don't even appreciate them as much as I'd like to. I'm proud of myself for the self-care I try to do!</p>\\n<p>Here are some tips for surviving a day with an anxiety disorder or depression, every little glimpse of joy helps:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Prayer. Whether you are a Christian or not, I have to believe prayer is powerful. Just giving your heart over, your cares over, to a higher power is transformative. It's a release. It's cathartic. My husband and I both try to live our lives in a constant state of prayer. It's like a constant connection with God. I'm not talking to myself all day; rather I keep my heart and mind open. I silently ask for guidance, peace, assurance. It's what keeps me going and what fills me with unexpected bursts of joy. This Sunday our Pastor said \\\"Setting aside time with God for prayer is like breathing if you want to live,\\\". That's how essential prayer can become to our being and to our mental health. It's just as important as breath- wow.</li>\\n<li>Talking. There is something significant about saying your thoughts and emotions out loud. To say something out loud gives it solidarity; it turns your emotions into something tangible. When you can put to words what you're feeling you will be more able to understand them. Words swimming around in your head often get lost, tangled, and warped together. You think yourself into a hole and then try to think yourself back out of the hole. It's just not possible. When I get the opportunity to share my heart with someone- I love it. I am usually very hesitant to share my real feelings with people unless we have a deep relationship or I am heavily prompted. If you're someone who can express your emotions freely, I envy you. What a gift.</li>\\n<li>Taking deep breaths. I know, sorta sounds like a clich. But breathing is shown to be relaxing! Yoga is all about the breath. Breath is powerful. If I feel my heart racing or my teeth clenching, I try to stop and take at least three deep breaths. In through the nose... count to three... out through the nose... count to three. Sometimes I realize I haven't taken a deep breath in hours, my breath has been short and stifled. I've been so concentrated on the task at hand or deep in my thoughts I forget to replenish my oxygen supply. Try it sometime this week.</li>\\n<li>Hot showers. Taking a hot shower is like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and melting the world away. I love love love hot showers. If we had a bathtub, I would soak in it at every chance (we WILL get one some day). I had a professor in college who was the head of the Social Work department and also had her own child psychology practice. She dealt with things like sexual abuse, abandonment, and death on a daily basis. Talk about producing anxiety and depression. She valued her hot showers and told us she would get in the shower after a long day at work and picture the stress and 'junk' of the day literally washing down the drain off her body. This was her way of releasing it.</li>\\n<li>Sleep. If I feel sick, I want to sleep. If I'm sad, I want to sleep. If I'm lonely, I want to sleep. When I'm anxious, I can't sleep, but dearly want to. Sleep is the time your brain organizes and categorizes itself. We cannot survive without sleep, and the more the merrier in my mind. I'm the girl who can't function without her eight hours a night. Studies show that those who do not get enough sleep deal with greater amounts of depression. Your brain and body need rest! A couple times a week I go to bed really early- maybe more than that if you ask my husband. I wake up early for work and by the time the day is over, i'm completely drained. I usually feel great the next day as long as I get proper rest. For those who can't sleep through the night; I've been there. Keep trying everything, eventually you will find something that works. Don't give up!   </li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>My grandma always tells me, \\\"Just do the footwork and allow God to do the rest,\\\". All we can do is take care of ourselves and try to strive for healing in all areas of our lives. When I get mad at myself for not doing all the self-care I think I should be doing, I try to realize I can't heal myself. That's where the Lord has to come in.</p>\\n<p>yogaRachel Brathen aka \\\"Yoga Girl\\\" is super awesome, she is always posting amazing photos and inspirational thoughts. I recommend following her on Instagram or checking out her website. She is someone who embraces self-care and knows what it's like to deal with depression. I love reading through her posts!</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"WLZ2PnprGwyg4aoyQ46Q2\",\"title\":\"My Favorite Word: Catharsis\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.5061511423550087,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/41C262tALCwQ6GASMGsSuY/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/my-fav-word.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/41C262tALCwQ6GASMGsSuY/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/my-fav-word.png?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/41C262tALCwQ6GASMGsSuY/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/my-fav-word.png?w=400&h=266&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/41C262tALCwQ6GASMGsSuY/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/my-fav-word.png?w=800&h=531&q=50 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/41C262tALCwQ6GASMGsSuY/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/my-fav-word.png?w=857&h=569&q=50 857w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/41C262tALCwQ6GASMGsSuY/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/my-fav-word.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/41C262tALCwQ6GASMGsSuY/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/my-fav-word.png?w=200&h=133&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/41C262tALCwQ6GASMGsSuY/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/my-fav-word.png?w=400&h=266&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/41C262tALCwQ6GASMGsSuY/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/my-fav-word.png?w=800&h=531&q=50&fm=webp 800w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/41C262tALCwQ6GASMGsSuY/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/my-fav-word.png?w=857&h=569&q=50&fm=webp 857w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c41C262tALCwQ6GASMGsSuY\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/41C262tALCwQ6GASMGsSuY/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/my-fav-word.png\",\"fileName\":\"my-fav-word.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Catharsis =the purging of the emotions or relieving of emotional tensions.</p>\\n<p>My favorite word.

month my pastor asked if I would share part of my story with the congregation. He was talking about the healing power of Jesus. He wanted me to express how the Lord and my faith have helped me through a difficult time in my life; and how they are continuing to help.</p>\\n<p>With the talent of a friend, we had it video recorded and then played on Sunday morning. I am always happy to share some of my story with those who are interested. I love sharing for a few different reasons:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>It reminds others, and myself, that <a href=\\\"http://abovethebattle.com/five-reasons-to-not-strive-for-perfection/\\\">I am not perfect</a>. I have struggles, my life feels like it's falling apart sometimes. I want people to know that about me. We are all in this together.</li>\\n<li>It's a step out of my comfort zone, and I believe it's the things we are afraid of that we must do.</li>\\n<li>It gives me a chance to share about the love and presence of God I have in my life. I want everyone to know what I experienced, and sharing my story gives me a chance to do that without being too 'preachy'.</li>\\n<li>And the last reason is, hopefully, I can provide comfort and hope to someone else who is in a similar situation. I got through it. You will get through it.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>In this video I share only bits and pieces of my story. <strong>It's not even close to the full reality I was facing</strong>, this was a five minute clip for church. I couldn't show any of my meltdowns as my grandma held me tight, my sleepless face, my blank mind, the pain I had in my gut, and the fear that followed me everywhere. That's not something you can capture in five minutes.</p>\\n<p>If you'd like to watch it, please do. If you'd like to share it with someone you know who is hurting, please share. If you want to learn more about a loved one who is struggling with anxiety and depression, this might give you a small glimpse into their thought processes.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV76gJMmdEc&#x26;feature=youtu.be\\\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV76gJMmdEc&#x26;feature=youtu.be</a></p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c11QLNkfgPGm4OsQKCcWICg\",\"title\":\"A Letter to the Lost\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAUCAIAAAAC64paAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAB3RJTUUH4gIXAhQDlHV+7gAAA4ZJREFUOMttkMtuHGUQhavqv/Tf3dM9nhmPHdl44lsUlAhLIHZRBALxBrxElHdBvAPPgITEFmXBApCIiBNLMTAx9ji+zExP9/R/ZxEnZMFZlOroq3MWhd8+fqSUIIaDsvP5B0OWCl5mKHgMMVrvtfnl+fjw/PrD/a3tnJcBeK6QMFpNnYwb45zziRK9RMpexzetm9aUK2QUnQv18mC0/s+i3fUhF2TOZvXZtcykzAQi0mavNM7XtZ5cL4ILrMhYrsCHsDRh2RJDxvDhZ594Y2RHym4qi1TkCcQYrKUv7+9knJep+uLTu3a6MNMGuaBUYYoQIkjOB/nqsOje2aSVTG731O6QlSlJDkhcT6YPbm/URuPZZXMxq5YWUjUv0/V+3k8lSsH6BWYhu7MW6jkRMkzApe7kCkXCl1Vd+GCWZtIYawIlDIu830nsor2Krj/aod4axAqgggRDa1jGUKXYH/z8w6982RjEuLpze//RYwAAgFBVyFhsWyACIlQKrMU8h7fSL350x8cfj4bcxcgg5isJcX4DEWNdh4sLTBJApOEwVBXrdt+FUShKRNCBD7fXPLpI/D+W52E6pW6XyhJCgBjpvSQA2OMzFJKvZry8PcRCBpkAAMQYvQ/zOeY5KoWch6qCEIDzaC0SAREgLiKHhc87gpvTKxZzdksBgBuPQ1WBc0CEnANRqCp5cODGY39yglLy3V1Mkub3k+8Pf3Oa8XR7U4xuUXcVAPhoBP8nsbf3vsVluJuVT6XmlGXOhfmLl5sbH0GMNzxGQLyxb5Z3EzEZZFv5Wn9f8p+ePF3N0ntfPQzOgXM312/fDiG8Cdw0AgBjz56fL1/+rdoVHH/3TW+0gUpGR7Mnf0xfXWnrFwvDU5IrghVqXldOexui8EBz1Je+MSZCrDqed5LO8nS61CH31swacD6XpLaS+YW2GrCIBBCDiy6auY9zYICp4k0aD/WCx9ZDP8uaeai1U1QOOshZ3WoxoDZCfakNOGCCM9K+bhpXdmSWy41BOZkHbqrGVLOMSX3dXJp2Y63rF/48aGtN+1qzlBptORNiqC7Bixi1D9z6k6PzB3vr7Ot796e6HhRdF73azBptnk1eVw3ESbOoLS+wrUJb2Suwa0oFFxgR80AeJiczftG2K5T+dXTKC3F1Vh9dz7L19dXrhTFBm7D8s+30EmfsVjoQ0iRl4V6ZjAghMg//AuB05YAoOtaHAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/4UsLQ7I3wciYK4WISM6acU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/there-is-joy-all-around-you..png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/4UsLQ7I3wciYK4WISM6acU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/there-is-joy-all-around-you..png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/4UsLQ7I3wciYK4WISM6acU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/there-is-joy-all-around-you..png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/4UsLQ7I3wciYK4WISM6acU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/there-is-joy-all-around-you..png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/4UsLQ7I3wciYK4WISM6acU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/there-is-joy-all-around-you..png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/4UsLQ7I3wciYK4WISM6acU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/there-is-joy-all-around-you..png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/4UsLQ7I3wciYK4WISM6acU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/there-is-joy-all-around-you..png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/4UsLQ7I3wciYK4WISM6acU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/there-is-joy-all-around-you..png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c4UsLQ7I3wciYK4WISM6acU\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/4UsLQ7I3wciYK4WISM6acU/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/there-is-joy-all-around-you..png\",\"fileName\":\"there-is-joy-all-around-you..png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Hey you.

Maybe a bad year?</p>\\n<p>This letter is for you; this is a letter of hope. This is an encouragement to help you rise above your battle.

one more person says that to me about the anxiety I feel, I might punch them.</p>\\n<p>Anyone relate?</p>\\n<p>Struggling with anxiety and depression is SO much more than simple thoughts you can control. When someone gets Bronchitis, do you tell them to try not to think about it? My therapist (who is wonderful, by the way) describes an anxiety disorder like Bronchitis of the brain. It needs to be treated like a real medical issue. Instead of a virus attacking your lungs, your brain is attacking itself. Thats the way I see it. With an anxiety or depression disorder your neurotransmitters are not doing their job. They are out of whack. When the anxiety is severe enough, there may be no thought or meditation that can relax your whacky neurotransmitters. They need help being restored to balance, just like your body does with any medication.</p>\\n<p>You broke your foot? Just try not to think about it. The pain isnt real. You dont need medical treatment. Its all in your head. Would we ever say that to someone?</p>\\n<p>I am writing this article in response to all the people out there who dont understand anxiety. I know it can be frustrating. You love someone, you see them struggling, you try to give them advice about how to not think about their anxiety. On the surface it seems like a loving thing to do. And believe me, people who deal with anxiety or depression need to be reminded they are loved unconditionally. However, telling him or her not to think about it is an extremely ignorant, and potentially harmful, thing to say. I do not mean it as an insult, rather i mean it as its most formal definition.</p>\\n<p>Ignorant = lacking knowledge, information, or awareness about something in particular.</p>\\n<p>Those who are ignorant about anxiety or depression disorders should not give advice about curing those disorders. Opinions and thoughts are welcome when they are said from an area of compassion and in a way that takes each individuals feelings into concern.</p>\\n<p>I am not a doctor so I realize I do not know the ins and outs and the inner-workings of brain chemistry. However, I have done my fair share of research on trying to better understand my mind. It helps me feel less weak when I can better understand my brain and how it is functioning. For more reading on anxiety disorders, I recommend reading this article here. It explains everything from causes to treatments. It might also be helpful to share with those who are telling you to not think about it.</p>\\n<p>My dad is a very kind man. He would do anything for me or my sisters, and we know it. It pains him to see me when Im down: he feels powerless. He always tells me to pray more, read my Bible more, give it to God. Dont worry! All of that is such great advice. I think we need to incorporate those things into our daily lives, anxiety or not. However, what do you do when youve tried all those things, and it doesnt seem to help?</p>\\n<p>Because of the lack of education on topics of mental health, especially in the church, Ive often felt like a failure. Ive failed myself. Ive failed God. I cant handle the stress Im experiencing. There must be something wrong with me- I must not be praying enough. I must not trust God enough to give it to Him. Just try not to think about it right?</p>\\n<p>THIS IS A LIE. Thats the problem, we are relying on our own strength and ability to give our cares to the Lord.</p>\\n<p>We dont need to try harder, we need to fall harder.</p>\\n<p>-Ashley</p>\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{\"category\":\"Depression\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n//

due date was Monday, November fourteenth. I woke up and went to work just like any other day- except this day I was hoping to not return home. I had hopes for a natural birth. The doctors told me I was young and healthy, this was going to be great. I kept telling my coworkers I thought my water was going to break; a woman just knows when somethings not 'normal' down there. Late into the night I got into bed and felt a warm gush... just like the doctor said I would. Then we were off! I was so incredibly excited yet calm. We texted, called, and emailed family and coworkers. Life was about to change and I just had no idea what to expect.</p>\\n<p>We parked in the parking garage and I felt a sense of pride that I could still walk around, although I was definitely leaving a mess behind. My husband made me ride in a wheelchair, which was probably the best idea. He's good at being kind to me.</p>\\n<p>The hospital was eerily quiet, but it was two in the morning. No contractions started so the doctors had me pacing the hallways in my fancy hospital socks. One hour, two hours, nothing. And then came my first unexpected blow: we need to induce you. Sorry, you're not progressing.</p>\\n<p>Five hours later and still less than halfway dilated. My heart dropped to the floor when the doctor (the first of three) told me this was going to be an evening baby and the sun had barely just risen. I had no energy left at this point. Then came unexpected blow number two: I asked for the epidural.</p>\\n<p>Time passed in a haze as I lay in the hospital bed, contracting but barely feeling anything but a heaviness, listening to a repeating soundtrack my husband put on as a distraction. People kept bringing him food; I was beyond envious he didn't have to live through the day like I did.</p>\\n<p>Late into the evening there was a doctor, a nurse, two nurse interns, and my husband all in the room when my doctor said the biggest unexpected blow number three: you might want to consider a c-section at this point. Baby is not dropping and you seem to not be dilated beyond eight centimeters. That's when the tears came. And the vomit. Did I mention all the vomit? They said it was the medication, lack of food, hormones... either way it sucked. I was so desperate for relief and afraid the baby would never come so I said yes. And I don't regret my decision, I just feel sad for the way I experienced it.</p>\\n<p>I remember telling Jacob in the hospital that I was never having another baby. We were adopting. That is that. Everyone said I would change my mind... but I think i'm still working through the trauma of it all. We want Eli to have a sibling: to learn how to share and live in community. I just don't know if I can handle that experience again. When you battle anxiety and depression, mixed with wacky hormones, throw in an unexpected emergency surgery, oh and a real life baby: you get fear. I have lived with fear since the moment he was born. Please don't misunderstand, I have joy. I love that child more than I love myself. But there is a degree of fear underlying my thoughts I can't quite put my finger on.</p>\\n<p>Today and every day I try to live in the present. I try to hold him and rock him to sleep and not to rush this time of life together. I pray, I ask for guidance, call the doctor all the time, and try not to take myself too seriously.</p>\\n<p>We sure did get lucky with a baby who still smiles at me even though he can't breathe out of his nose right now. My grandma told me he was going to bring a lot of joy into our lives and she was correct. Despite my fear, despite my uncertainty, he is teaching me to just sit there and giggle with him.</p>\\n<p>Welcome to this crazy world Eli William!</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"tOQlNA9lyoskcoUgqMEqm\",\"title\":\"Between Life & Death\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3AigLCTIUEyKuoCy8MGK8E/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/052819-1.png\",\"fileName\":\"052819-1.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>I'm sitting here on my balcony looking at the last little triangle of sunlight shining on a tree as it sets behind us. I'm tired. Baby is rumbling around inside; I can see his little kicks through my shirt. Husband is unwinding with a video game. Dog is resting. Grandma is dying.</p>\\n<p>It's hard to live life when there's so much good and so much bad.</p>\\n<p>Living between anticipated new life and anticipated death is a weird space. And both are completely new to me. That's scary. I have no idea what it's like to give birth or to be a mother; and I have no idea what it's like to lose someone I truly love with all my soul. Yet both are inevitably going to happen, and sooner than I feel ready for.</p>\\n<p>Tears burn my eyes. My throat feels like it's closing in as I try to not let emotion overcome me. The sadness and the fear are so strong in these moments.</p>\\n<p>I take a few minutes to check social media because I'm not sure what I'm trying to say or where my thoughts are headed. All I know is that I'm caught in a gray area- dark gray. That means it's time to pray.</p>\\n<p>There are five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. I keep wondering if I'm in this cycle. Is there a stage called confusion? That seems more accurate. All those other feelings come and go. Who invented this formula for grief? How can anyone decide who experiences what? Maybe some people can't get past the depression; that is frightening. Maybe some people slip right into acceptance because their faith is so strong they know who is in control. I want that. I want so much trust in the Lord nothing so \\\"normal\\\" as life and death could shake me.</p>\\n<p>Alas, I am reminded of my humanness. I see my humanness in the sadness of my sister, the stress of my grandfather, the tears of my uncle, and the embrace of my husband. We are in this together.</p>\\n<p>Last night my grandmother was asked, \\\"What is one thing you want to leave with us?\\\" Her response, \\\"We are all one.\\\"</p>\\n<p><strong>We are all one.</strong></p>\\n<p>Grandma and I are one. My grandmother and my son are one. Even in her final days when all I want to do is help her, she is teaching us all.

No line, no change in color, so I set it on the counter and started to brush my teeth. Didn't want to be late for work. I happened to glance back down at it before throwing it in the trash and I saw the beginning of a pink streak.</p>\\n<p>OH MY GOSH. (those weren't the exact words that came out...)</p>\\n<p>If my years working at a pregnancy center taught me anything it was that any pink line meant something was going on. This was real.</p>\\n<p>I always had the vision I would find out I was pregnant, keep it from my husband until I could come up with some cute little baby surprise and wow him. Well, none of that happens in real life.</p>\\n<p>I instantly woke him up, tried to get words out through my hyper breathing, and told him what the test said. He replied with a slobbery lisp through his nighttime mouth guard, \\\"Are you serious?\\\".</p>\\n<p>Pure romance.</p>\\n<p>I was told about three years ago from a doctor, \\\"Once you get pregnant, your anxiety will significantly improve. You will probably not need any medication and in fact, your hormone levels might stabilize and you'll never need medication again.\\\" That is not a direct quote but rather the gist of the conversation. I was skeptical of this projection; but really hoping and praying those words were true.</p>\\n<p>For me, they weren't.</p>\\n<p>In fact, my anxiety became unmanageable after my doctor told me to quickly ween of all medication and just suck it up. Maybe the pregnancy would give me more 'motivation'. Needless to say I was terrified, angry, and desperate for relief and peace.</p>\\n<p>All I could think about was how in the world was I suppose to be a mother when I could barely find the motivation to get through the day, let alone smile.</p>\\n<p>Since then I have sought the opinion of three other doctors (one of them being a highly-qualified specialist in maternal infant health psychiatry). I am back on a steady dose of medication, saw my therapist for a couple months, and feeling overall huge improvements.</p>\\n<p>I lost myself for a month. I was unable to enjoy and fully celebrate the fact I was creating life inside me because the worry, anxiety, and depression completely took over. If you are ever in a similar situation; seek multiple opinions. Ultimately you will know what's best. Most often the best decision is the one where you feel whole and complete. That's what my child needs; a mother who can be present, whole, complete, and peaceful.</p>\\n<p>Since finding out we were going to have a baby, life has gotten crazy. We realized we needed to move... a tiny 400 square-foot apartment with a baby and a black lab just wasn't how I wanted to spend my time. Thus began the searching and moving process.</p>\\n<p>Almost four months into my pregnancy I was driving home from work and was hit by a man trying to cross five lanes of traffic, right into the drivers side. That resulted in a multitude of medical tests and tears, all of which came back fine. We are praising the Lord for that!</p>\\n<p>Then my husband found out some not-so-encouraging medical news, which has completely upped my stress level.</p>\\n<p>Then our doggie hurt his paw and had to go to the emergency vet and wear the cone of shame for a whole week. He was even on dog narcotics! It was sad but almost comical to watch.</p>\\n<p>Then we bought our new car and it's already in the shop. We've owned it for four days.</p>\\n<p>I forgot to mention in the midst of all this I started a new job and Jacob is having trouble at his work. When my husband, who is always the calm one, is constantly stressed it really throws us for a loop.</p>\\n<p>My beloved grandmother is going through a possible cancer-scare, which has our whole family in tense waiting.</p>\\n<p>We are moving to a completely new city in a month and a half.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say I am so thankful for the medication I am able to take to help me cope with life lately. I am even more thankful for the Lord's constant provision and peace. <a href=\\\"https://bible.org/seriespage/60-compound-names-jehovah-jireh-rapha-nissi\\\">Jehovah-jireh</a>, the Lord provides. My favorite saying and my favorite truth to live day by day.</p>\\n<p>\\\"The Revelation of the Name <strong>Jehovah-Jireh</strong>, Genesis 22:12-14. The meaning of this name is The Lord Who Provides. The name is literally, The Lord Who Sees, or The Lord Who Will See To It. This is what we long for when we have a need that is personal and special; One who will see to our needs and provide for us. This is what Jehovah-Jireh means; the Lord Who will see to it that my every need is met. One Who knows my need because He sees.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Regular life stress can be really difficult for someone dealing with an anxiety disorder. What some can brush of and 'not worry about' can consume others. We have to be patient with those around us who we don't fully understand. I can't even express how much patience and compassion are necessary to help me through any struggle.</p>\\n<p>On a positive note, we are just days away from finding out the gender! Will we need a pink or blue nursery??</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c50J6syQf1YS4I2WkQI4YaO\",\"title\":\"If You're Going Through Hell\",\"createdAt\":\"February 20, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.4989293361884368,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=400&h=267&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=700&h=467&q=50 700w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=200&h=133&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=400&h=267&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg?w=700&h=467&q=50&fm=webp 700w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/3vg5jNkGa4m2mywWkyQmEQ/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg\",\"fileName\":\"photo-1422568374078-27d3842ba676.jpg\",\"contentType\":\"image/jpeg\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Ever have those days, weeks, maybe even months when you are just in a funk?

My current favorites are Serial and Heather Dubrow's World. I listen to them every week while I walk the dog, drive in the car, or go to the gym. Earlier this week I was listening once again as I happily worked out on the spin bike (okay fine, I was sweating profusely and constantly staring at the 30 minute timer willing it to end). Anyways, I heard a podcast with and the featured guest was <a href=\\\"http://kristiling.com/\\\">Kristi Ling</a>, the happiness strategist. I really don't like the word 'happy' because it's such a fluffy word. It just sounds so shallow to me.</p>\\n<p>Everyone wants to be happy, find their happiness, find someone to make them happy.</p>\\n<p>When I heard this lady who is an expert on happiness was coming on to the show I wasn't expecting much...honestly. However, she had great points and great ideas- I was so inspired I decided to write about it. I actually, perhaps, maybe, will consider buying her newest book.</p>\\n<p>Kristi Ling wears a rattlesnake ring every day. Kind of a weird piece of jewelry if you ask me. For her, it's a daily reminder to 'save her venom'.</p>\\n<p>Rattlesnakes have very poisonous venom. They need it to kill their prey so they can eat and survive. If approached by a threat, the snake will not strike. They wait until they are absolutely sure their very life is being threatened. Why? They need to save their venom! If they don't preserve their supply, they won't have it when they really need it. It's a waste.</p>\\n<p>I LOVE THIS ANALOGY.</p>\\n<p>I need to save my venom! It so perfectly relates to those struggling with anxiety. We get so anxious and freaked out by what-ifs all the time. Our fight or flight responses kick in and we go into hyper drive. For me, it doesn't matter if there is a real dangerous threat, my venom is ready to strike at any hint of fear.</p>\\n<p>The other day I was driving in the car and started to become consumed with worry that my car would break down and I would have no way to get to work. I started thinking about how we would pay for repairs, could we afford a new car, would Jacob be able to drive me to work in the morning?</p>\\n<p>Then I paused and remembered the rattlesnake. I want to be a rattlesnake. I want to save my venom.

Fear of death, fear of isolation, fear of no control, fear of the feeling lasting forever. Those are some of the things I've experienced. The most helpful 'tool in my toolbox' (a phrase my Grandmother uses) to help me through a panic attack is <strong>knowledge.</strong></p>\\n<p>My first anxiety attack was by far the worst because I had no idea what was going on. I literally thought I was going crazy. Today through learning, reading, talking, sharing, I am able to successfully talk myself out of a full-blown panic attack on most occasions.</p>\\n<p>It's uncomfortable for me to admit this but yes, I experienced an more-intense-than-usual anxiety attack a little while ago. I still struggle with this. They always sneak up out of nowhere, don't they?</p>\\n<p>In the midst of the chaos, I realized I was talking to myself (in my head, don't worry). Once I came to this epiphany, that I did actually know what was going on with my body and why it was happening, I was so excited! How cool is it to learn new things about yourself?</p>\\n<p>Everything seems less scary to me when I understand it. <strong>Knowledge is power.</strong></p>\\n<p>After the event dissipated I immediately started writing my thought process down. I knew I had to share it and perhaps you'll be able to learn something new and become more successful at talking yourself through scary moments.</p>\\n<p>Please observe,</p>\\n<p><strong>How to talk yourself through a panic attack:</strong></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Understand what is going on with your body. When you experience a panic attack or feel that initial rush of adrenaline, your neurotransmitters in your brain are firing like crazy. Sometimes they don't calm down quite as they should, and your body thinks it's in immediate danger. Sometimes this happens out of nowhere, with no observable trigger. This is why it's called an \\\"attack\\\". Pause and realize what's going on. Talk to your neurotransmitters- become friends with them!</li>\\n<li>Realizing you CAN still breathe. Take. Deep. Breaths.</li>\\n<li>Nothing lasts forever. Even this unbearable feeling. You may have to repeat this out loud. \\\"I am okay, I am okay, I am okay.\\\"</li>\\n<li>I'm not alone, you're not alone.</li>\\n<li>Be kind to yourself. You are not weak, you are not lesser.</li>\\n<li>Understand your triggers if they exist. Try to figure out what triggers your panic and think about why.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>It's no secret holidays cause stress. No matter how hard I try to remain calm, it has yet to happen. Between family tensions and holiday shopping, there is a lot of pressure.</p>\\n<p>I might experience some panic, maybe you will too. With some practice we will be able to fight the anxiety and talk ourselves down and be able to spend more time reflecting on the reason for the season rather than in our own heads.</p>\\n<p>Merry Christmas xox</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c7bUrX4VCX6cUmQwgqcSaEO\",\"title\":\"Jesus Gets It\",\"createdAt\":\"February 19,

haven't written anything in a couple months because I've been tired, stressed, busy, a combination of all those things. Just dealing with life. And a new dog (he is super cute). And a new school year. And laundry.</p>\\n<p>I sometimes forget or neglect to sit down and think about things when I get so wrapped up in life. That's exactly what I needed to do: write, reflect, breathe, share.</p>\\n<p>I'm slightly mad at myself for putting these things off for the past two months but Jesus gets it. He understands. He was there.</p>\\n<p>I've been (very slowly) reading my way through a <a href=\\\"http://sheilawalsh.com/\\\">Sheila Walsh</a> book titled \\\"God Loves Broken People (And Those Who Pretend They're Not)\\\". Every page is juicy and makes me want to share it. I have little bookmarks and folded corners all over the book. Sheila admits she's broken and helps us see that we are too. She strongly emphasizes how the darkness in our souls can open us to the intimacy and love of Jesus we might not have known otherwise. Jesus suffered, he shares in our suffering.</p>\\n<p>\\\"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled,\\\" John 11:33</p>\\n<p>Sheila explains the word 'moved' here is translated from the Greek word 'embrimaomai'. That word is strong and represents anger, strength, or the bellowing and snorting of a horse. Some might say fury. Christ was feeling fury at the pain Mary and Martha were feeling in this situation. She points out that Christ rages with us.</p>\\n<p>How differently would we experience pain if we truly understood that Jesus feels with us?</p>\\n<p>I've been trying to reflect on that over the weekend.

And I repeat it to myself every now and again.When we are in the midst of a rough time it's easy to lose perspective.</p>\\n<p>Ever heard of hashtag firstworldproblems? The problems we face seem really strange to those in other countries who don't have any clean water to drink or who are dying because they don't have access to basic antibiotics. The funny thing is, we know this!</p>\\n<p>Ex: My cookie dough ice cream doesn't have enough cookie dough. #firstworldproblems</p>\\n<p>(I actually found this quote on <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/Ashley_Manzo\\\">Twitter</a>, fyi)</p>\\n<p>I know we all have heard about poverty and world hunger. Those numbers are easy to hear and easy to forget. Let me give you a little refresher for a clear perspective.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>According to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty.</li>\\n<li>Preventable diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia take the lives of 2 million children a year.</li>\\n<li>1/4 of all humans live without electricity approximately 1.6 billion people.</li>\\n<li>For more stats <a href=\\\"https://www.dosomething.org/facts/11-facts-about-global-poverty\\\">click here.</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This computer we are on and the cell phone you just used is a luxury. 1.6 billion people in this world don't even have access to electricity. And we have other luxuries like toilets and air conditioning. I don't know what I would do without those last two!</p>\\n<p>I know when I'm facing a hard time or in the midst of an internal crisis, nothing you could say to me would make much of a difference. I don't have the mental capacity to step outside of myself and view this life through a healthy perspective. I'm not minimizing our first world problems; to us, they really are struggles. Anxiety and depression are a HUGE issue in the United States. People who have never faced hunger face these things on a daily basis. I think by staying present and being in a constant state of realizing how blessed we are, we can be more equipped to keep our life in perspective when a breakdown occurs.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes I feel like if we've never been taught how to look outside ourselves or never experienced other cultures, we don't know how to see anything but our own wants and needs.</p>\\n<p>Working with young teenagers is a great way to see up close and personal how egocentric our culture is. They don't realize it and it's definitely a part of the maturing process, but I find it funny. Was I the same way at fourteen? Did my life crumble around me if my cell phone broke or someone said something to me the wrong way? Maybe.</p>\\n<p>Our culture is all about \\\"me\\\". It's about how \\\"I\\\" feel, what \\\"I\\\" want, if \\\"I'm\\\" offended... I remember my mother having a shirt that said \\\"I Heart Me\\\" on it. How strange is that? Most of us don't walk around displaying our self-centeredness but our thoughts and actions do it for us.</p>\\n<p>YOU might be having a bad day, but that doesn't mean YOU have a bad life. Let's be open to keeping a clear perspective. I challenge myself and I challenge you to take a step outside yourself and be thankful. The next time you're having a bad day, take a moment to remember you don't have a bad life.</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c1c5S1Vo0io640iYGWwYugU\",\"title\":\"The Day My Life Changed\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=200&h=200&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=400&h=400&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png?w=800&h=800&q=50&fm=webp 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"c6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/6EpJK89WBG4KoSkkAQqoC0/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png\",\"fileName\":\"Do-not-be-anxious-about-anything-but-in.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>July 7th, 2013. Just an ordinary day. If I remember correctly, it was extremely hot. We were in the middle of a summer scorcher. I woke up, refused to get out of bed for the usual 7am Wednesday morning yoga class. Snoozed my alarm for almost 2 hours. Ate some toast. Then went to work.</p>\\n<p>I was a waitress at the time. Being a waitress is a great job; and it's a horrible job. You see the best of humanity - happy families on vacation, birthday celebrations, couples celebrating 50 years of marriage. Then, you see the worse of humanity - hot tourists who are so 'hangry' you can never bring the food fast enough, people who complain about the prices even though it was free-will to dine at that restaurant, toddlers who can't seem to get it together, and servers when they are pissed off at the world.</p>\\n<p>There are a certain type of people who work at restaurants. Some even make a career out of it. Know what I'm talking about? I've worked in a couple different places, and most of the employees have similar traits. I never quite fit in. I don't swear, I don't sleep with coworkers, I don't have nipple piercings (that was a real thing I encountered), and I don't go to strip clubs.</p>\\n<p>On July 7th, 2013 my coworkers were talking about their latest endeavor. They were planning on 'initiating' an 18 year old bus boy into adulthood by taking him to a 'refined' strip club. They asked me, sorta halfheartedly if I would like to join them. I said no. And for once I stood up for myself and I told them why. Always, I stay quiet. I was the 'good girl'. I never joined in on the party but I never stopped it either. So this time I shared my opinion and that was the last moment I ever felt \\\"normal\\\".</p>\\n<p>I told them how I believe the sex industry is out-of-control. I don't remember the exact words I used but I know I talked about human trafficking and how it's a REAL ISSUE in the United States. And I said that by going to a strip club, I would feel like I was participating in that and contributing money. No can do.</p>\\n<p>Nobody wants to think about morals when it comes to having a good time. Nobody likes the party crasher who is over-religious and making people feel bad for a decision that I believe deep down inside, they agreed with. Those were the thoughts going through my head at the time. At least something like that because all I remember after that is sitting down on the floor right where I stood because I swore I was going to pass out.</p>\\n<p>I was so hot. My hands were shaking. I was light headed. I thought I was having some sort of allergic reaction to a muffin I just ate. I asked my coworkers for some Benadryl, no luck. They got me orange juice- said I must have low blood sugar. That was a possibility, I suppose.</p>\\n<p>I stood up and moved from the floor to a chair. Then the tears came streaming down. Endless tears. It's like I had no control of my body. I remember feeling intense fear, I had no idea what was going on with me. Was I going to pass out? Was I dying? I felt like I was short of breath. My throat had to be closing in on itself because my inhales weren't quite what they should be.</p>\\n<p>No body knew how to respond so they called security. A man picked me up and drove me to the closest urgent care in town. On the way there he asked, \\\"You aren't going to pass out on me or anything are you?\\\" Umm, I don't freakin' know. Aren't you prepared for this type of thing?</p>\\n<p>After waiting for what seemed like forever at the urgent care and being hit on by the creepy doctor, he diagnosed me with low blood sugar. Then proceeded to tell me how I was destined to be a nurse so I didn't have to 'rely on any man'.</p>\\n<p>Urgent care took me back to work, I drove home in a daze, andunknowingly set out on a journey that would produce countless sleepless nights, panic attacks, and fear. Just a lot of fear.</p>\\n<p>Needless to say, July 7th is a big anniversary for me. Not the kind with chocolates and flowers (although that's not a bad idea Jacob...); but it's a reminder for me of where I am and where I came from. It's a reminder that I am a fragile human being whose only true source of strength is from the Lord. It's a reminder that I need to take care of myself and take my feelings seriously.</p>\\n<p>We all have those days in our lives that we can remember so vividly. If you asked me to tell you what I did on July 6th, couldn't tell you. But the 7th, I even remember exactly what I was wearing.</p>\\n<p>Painful experiences stick with us but eventually they don't sting as much and we are able to reflect and learn.</p>\\n<p>I spoke with a Pastor friend and he encouraged me to read the book of Philippians. I would repeat this verse over and over again in my mind until I could sleep. One night I think it was close to three hours of repetition.</p>\\n<p>Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</p>\\n<p>Philippians 4:6-7</p>\\n<p>Thanks for reading,</p>\\n<p>Ashley</p>\"}}},{\"id\":\"c6hDsNJTy0wMKcaQw4Uk4oe\",\"title\":\"Poetry\",\"createdAt\":\"February 18, 2018\",\"featuredImage\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.500952380952381,\"src\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=800&q=50\",\"srcSet\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=400&h=266&q=50 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=788&h=525&q=50 788w\",\"srcWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=800&q=50&fm=webp\",\"srcSetWebp\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=200&h=133&q=50&fm=webp 200w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=400&h=266&q=50&fm=webp 400w,\\n//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png?w=788&h=525&q=50&fm=webp 788w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"},\"id\":\"AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO\",\"file\":{\"url\":\"//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/AIUw71TRF628MaMmsEqmO/bf8e90962701acda5f785ee00663cefd/poetry.png\",\"fileName\":\"poetry.png\",\"contentType\":\"image/png\"}},\"content\":{\"childMarkdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>My husband and I are youth leaders at our church. This isn't something we necessarily planned; in fact, both of us would say we never desired to work with teenagers. The Lord must have had a plan because we've been leaders for over a year now, and we have fallen in love. Teenagers are complicated. Of course, I never thought I was a complicated or moody teenager- as I'm assuming most of them don't either. Adolescent years are key to discovering who you are, what you believe, and what you really want. I'm constantly being blown away by the depth of knowledge some of our students have. These two poems were written by girls just finishing up eight grade. They haven't experienced many years of life but they have lived through stuff I never hope to. I love these girls and think they have great potential! They shared some poems with me, and I wanted to share them with you:</p>\\n<p>Depression does not always mean beautiful girls shattering at their wrists. A glorified heroic battle for your sanity. Or a father's chance to say his last goodbye.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression is not getting out of bed for three days because your feet refuse to believe that they will not shatter upon impact with the floor.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression means that summoning the will power to go down stairs and do laundry is the most impressive thing you've accomplished all week.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression means lying on the floor staring at the ceiling for hours because you cannot convince your body that it is capable of movement.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression meansnot being able to write for weeks because the only words that you have to offer the world are trapped and drowning and I swear to God I'm trying.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression means that every single bone in your body aches but you have to keep going through the motions.Because you are not aloud to call into work or school 'depressed'.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes depression means ignoring every phone call for an entire month. Because yes, they have the right number, but you're not the person they're looking for, not anymore.</p>\\n<p>-C.</p>\\n<p>She was lost and broken inside.</p>\\n<p>No one to run to and no where to hide.</p>\\n<p>Someone came along and broke her down, she felt like she was going to drown.</p>\\n<p>Now she's completely done.</p>\\n<p>All she wanted to do was run.</p>\\n<p>Broken home, broken family, all she wanted to do was grow up happily.</p>\\n<p>Chased after a guy, and all he said was lies.</p>\\n<p>Now she has a broken heart, and soon to find someone to turn it into a work of art.</p>\\n<p>All tangled up in depression, and all she needs is another session.</p>\\n<p>Too much emotional pain is making her insane.</p>\\n<p>Prays every night and just wants to take flight into the brightest light.</p>\\n<p>Met a guy over the summer, then had to leave, what a bummer.</p>\\n<p>At her apartment, has too much to drink and needs to think.</p>\\n<p>Collapses to the floor, all of a sudden he busts open the door.</p>\\n<p>Laying in a hospital bed, he thought she was dead.</p>\\n<p>She sees him sitting in the chair, and thought he would never care.</p>\\n<p>He gets up, kisses her forehead, and whispers don't go back to bed.</p>\\n<p>-S.</p>\\n<p>On a side note, I love poetry. I'm not an avid writer or reader, but I often get sucked in. It amazes me how a specific compilation of words can produce such emotion. I know many people who use poetry or spoken word to get things off their chest and to express themselves.

When I feel anxiety and stress I blame myself and assume I'm not doing \\\"enough\\\" self-care. It must be my fault. Here I am, failing at life yet again.</p>\\n<p>Am I alone in this?</p>\\n<p>Thankfully, the logical side of my brain helps me realize this is idiotic. Worrying about my stress and pushing myself to do more to combat stress only produces more stress! It's so silly. When I talk about it out loud to my therapist or to a friend, I realize how crazy I sound. And actually, I have a lot of self-care routines I practice daily. They are embedded in my lifestyle now and I don't even appreciate them as much as I'd like to. I'm proud of myself for the self-care I try to do!</p>\\n<p>Here are some tips for surviving a day with an anxiety disorder or depression, every little glimpse of joy helps:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Prayer. Whether you are a Christian or not, I have to believe prayer is powerful. Just giving your heart over, your cares over, to a higher power is transformative. It's a release. It's cathartic. My husband and I both try to live our lives in a constant state of prayer. It's like a constant connection with God. I'm not talking to myself all day; rather I keep my heart and mind open. I silently ask for guidance, peace, assurance. It's what keeps me going and what fills me with unexpected bursts of joy. This Sunday our Pastor said \\\"Setting aside time with God for prayer is like breathing if you want to live,\\\". That's how essential prayer can become to our being and to our mental health. It's just as important as breath- wow.</li>\\n<li>Talking. There is something significant about saying your thoughts and emotions out loud. To say something out loud gives it solidarity; it turns your emotions into something tangible. When you can put to words what you're feeling you will be more able to understand them. Words swimming around in your head often get lost, tangled, and warped together. You think yourself into a hole and then try to think yourself back out of the hole. It's just not possible. When I get the opportunity to share my heart with someone- I love it. I am usually very hesitant to share my real feelings with people unless we have a deep relationship or I am heavily prompted. If you're someone who can express your emotions freely, I envy you. What a gift.</li>\\n<li>Taking deep breaths. I know, sorta sounds like a clich. But breathing is shown to be relaxing! Yoga is all about the breath. Breath is powerful. If I feel my heart racing or my teeth clenching, I try to stop and take at least three deep breaths. In through the nose... count to three... out through the nose... count to three. Sometimes I realize I haven't taken a deep breath in hours, my breath has been short and stifled. I've been so concentrated on the task at hand or deep in my thoughts I forget to replenish my oxygen supply. Try it sometime this week.</li>\\n<li>Hot showers. Taking a hot shower is like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and melting the world away. I love love love hot showers. If we had a bathtub, I would soak in it at every chance (we WILL get one some day). I had a professor in college who was the head of the Social Work department and also had her own child psychology practice. She dealt with things like sexual abuse, abandonment, and death on a daily basis. Talk about producing anxiety and depression. She valued her hot showers and told us she would get in the shower after a long day at work and picture the stress and 'junk' of the day literally washing down the drain off her body. This was her way of releasing it.</li>\\n<li>Sleep. If I feel sick, I want to sleep. If I'm sad, I want to sleep. If I'm lonely, I want to sleep. When I'm anxious, I can't sleep, but dearly want to. Sleep is the time your brain organizes and categorizes itself. We cannot survive without sleep, and the more the merrier in my mind. I'm the girl who can't function without her eight hours a night. Studies show that those who do not get enough sleep deal with greater amounts of depression. Your brain and body need rest! A couple times a week I go to bed really early- maybe more than that if you ask my husband. I wake up early for work and by the time the day is over, i'm completely drained. I usually feel great the next day as long as I get proper rest. For those who can't sleep through the night; I've been there. Keep trying everything, eventually you will find something that works. Don't give up!   </li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>My grandma always tells me, \\\"Just do the footwork and allow God to do the rest,\\\". All we can do is take care of ourselves and try to strive for healing in all areas of our lives. When I get mad at myself for not doing all the self-care I think I should be doing, I try to realize I can't heal myself. That's where the Lord has to come in.</p>\\n<p>yogaRachel Brathen aka \\\"Yoga Girl\\\" is super awesome, she is always posting amazing photos and inspirational thoughts. I recommend following her on Instagram or checking out her website. She is someone who embraces self-care and knows what it's like to deal with depression.

Prayer helps.</p>\\n<p>I've been experiencing the signs and symptoms of stress lately, and I am craving something cathartic.</p>\\n<p>I read a daily devotional; prayed out loud; watered my plants; went to the gym; I still felt bottled up.</p>\\n<p>With the suggestion of my physical therapist, I went back to yoga class this weekend, and it was like chatting with an old friend. I spent over an hour with my breath.</p>\\n<p>Breathe in for four counts, out for four counts. Again. Again. Again. For over an hour.</p>\\n<p>It helped a lot. Sleep helped.

My grandmother meditates every single morning- it has changed her life. Some people paint, play music, run, punch things. You do what you have to do to release emotions. The important thing is that you release your emotions. It is so unhealthy to keep everything bottled up. Jesus cried. Jesus experienced anger. He had emotions and expressed them. God created emotions- they are a beautiful thing! It makes us feel human, it makes us feel alive.</p>\\n<p>Do something cathartic today- this is a constant reminder for me.</p>\\n<p>What is your emotional

month my pastor asked if I would share part of my story with the congregation. He was talking about the healing power of Jesus. He wanted me to express how the Lord and my faith have helped me through a difficult time in my life; and how they are continuing to help.</p>\\n<p>With the talent of a friend, we had it video recorded and then played on Sunday morning. I am always happy to share some of my story with those who are interested. I love sharing for a few different reasons:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>It reminds others, and myself, that <a href=\\\"http://abovethebattle.com/five-reasons-to-not-strive-for-perfection/\\\">I am not perfect</a>. I have struggles, my life feels like it's falling apart sometimes. I want people to know that about me. We are all in this together.</li>\\n<li>It's a step out of my comfort zone, and I believe it's the things we are afraid of that we must do.</li>\\n<li>It gives me a chance to share about the love and presence of God I have in my life. I want everyone to know what I experienced, and sharing my story gives me a chance to do that without being too 'preachy'.</li>\\n<li>And the last reason is, hopefully, I can provide comfort and hope to someone else who is in a similar situation. I got through it. You will get through it.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>In this video I share only bits and pieces of my story. <strong>It's not even close to the full reality I was facing</strong>, this was a five minute clip for church.

one more person says that to me about the anxiety I feel, I might punch them.</p>\\n<p>Anyone relate?</p>\\n<p>Struggling with anxiety and depression is SO much more than simple thoughts you can control. When someone gets Bronchitis, do you tell them to try not to think about it? My therapist (who is wonderful, by the way) describes an anxiety disorder like Bronchitis of the brain. It needs to be treated like a real medical issue. Instead of a virus attacking your lungs, your brain is attacking itself. Thats the way I see it. With an anxiety or depression disorder your neurotransmitters are not doing their job. They are out of whack. When the anxiety is severe enough, there may be no thought or meditation that can relax your whacky neurotransmitters. They need help being restored to balance, just like your body does with any medication.</p>\\n<p>You broke your foot? Just try not to think about it. The pain isnt real. You dont need medical treatment. Its all in your head. Would we ever say that to someone?</p>\\n<p>I am writing this article in response to all the people out there who dont understand anxiety. I know it can be frustrating. You love someone, you see them struggling, you try to give them advice about how to not think about their anxiety. On the surface it seems like a loving thing to do. And believe me, people who deal with anxiety or depression need to be reminded they are loved unconditionally. However, telling him or her not to think about it is an extremely ignorant, and potentially harmful, thing to say. I do not mean it as an insult, rather i mean it as its most formal definition.</p>\\n<p>Ignorant = lacking knowledge, information, or awareness about something in particular.</p>\\n<p>Those who are ignorant about anxiety or depression disorders should not give advice about curing those disorders. Opinions and thoughts are welcome when they are said from an area of compassion and in a way that takes each individuals feelings into concern.</p>\\n<p>I am not a doctor so I realize I do not know the ins and outs and the inner-workings of brain chemistry. However, I have done my fair share of research on trying to better understand my mind. It helps me feel less weak when I can better understand my brain and how it is functioning. For more reading on anxiety disorders, I recommend reading this article here. It explains everything from causes to treatments. It might also be helpful to share with those who are telling you to not think about it.</p>\\n<p>My dad is a very kind man. He would do anything for me or my sisters, and we know it. It pains him to see me when Im down: he feels powerless. He always tells me to pray more, read my Bible more, give it to God. Dont worry! All of that is such great advice. I think we need to incorporate those things into our daily lives, anxiety or not. However, what do you do when youve tried all those things, and it doesnt seem to help?</p>\\n<p>Because of the lack of education on topics of mental health, especially in the church, Ive often felt like a failure. Ive failed myself. Ive failed God. I cant handle the stress Im experiencing. There must be something wrong with me- I must not be praying enough. I must not trust God enough to give it to Him. Just try not to think about it right?</p>\\n<p>THIS IS A LIE. Thats the problem, we are relying on our own strength and ability to give our cares to the Lord.</p>\\n<p>We dont need to try harder, we need to fall harder.</p>\\n<p>-Ashley</p>\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{\"category\":\"Depression\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/categories-depression.json\n// module id = 323\n// module chunks = 203003687630260"],"sourceRoot":""}
