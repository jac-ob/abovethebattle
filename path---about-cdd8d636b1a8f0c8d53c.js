I’m a twenty-something trying to navigate life, decide who I am, what I believe, and what I truly want. I’m a wife to a wonderful guy named Jacob. He’s loyal, patient, and my rock. I’m a new mommy to an adorable little man and I am still trying to figure it all out.</p>\n<p>I am a social worker with a local school district, and I love my job.</p>\n<p>Fouryears ago I experienced something that would forever change my life. I had my first encounter with anxiety attacks and PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). I’ve learned a lot since that time in my life, and I have found that not a ton of people talk about this issue, especially within Christian communities. Life is a battle and I’m still in the midst of healing. This has been a long, life-changing, yet somehow positive journey for me.</p>\n<p>I think every woman is beautiful. I think every woman has her own story. I think women need to know they’re not alone in their struggles. I think being honest and open with each other is the key to healing.</p>\n<p>I want to share my thoughts and my story, and hope you will share yours with me, too.</p>\n<p>Let’s rise above the battle… together.</p>\n<p><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/t8j0ewtik3c3/1SJwOWj61OsW60uMK4mc0Y/dd062979159b72782cdecf7266a41793/Honeymoon_01small-1024x445.jpg" alt="Honeymoon 01small-1024x445"></p>'}},contentful_id:"h7vmquhzhuuUKS0y0a06y",createdAt:"2018-02-25T00:53:30.306Z",updatedAt:"2018-07-10T01:35:36.938Z",node_locale:"en-US"}},pathContext:{}}}});
